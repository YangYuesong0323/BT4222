47,gm8pkpi,t3_krqrmf,Hello everyone! I was using Robinhood for my Bitcoin staff but I’m trying to move away from that platform completely. Which platform do you recommend to be the best. I’m in New York. I know some of these apps are not registered in NyS. I considered Gemini and Binance. Gemini seems to have very limited amount of coins. Thanks in advance,t3_krqrmf,2021-02-07 00:10:56,2021-02-07

I’m in the UK so I’m wondering what’s the best way to buy each week/month and where to store it to avoid the fees? I think Binance has a .005 withdrawal fee, so I’m open to anything that’s reputable and excepts UK people! Also, should I DCA every week or every month?",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-07 01:56:24,2021-02-07
50,gmaf0kr,t3_krqrmf,"Hi guys, as a beginner I wanna ask you some info about the platforms to use for my first purchase of crypto. My idea was to invest a small portion of my monthly earnings by buying Bitcoins on an exchange, withdraw them immediately and putting them on a wallet. Reading above I’ve seen that BlueWallet is the most suggested wallet to use for beginners that don’t want to spend money on a hardware wallet. So I’ve two question: I’m in Europe, what’s the best platform for beginners to buy bitcoins? It will be possibile in the future to move the bitcoins from BlueWallet to a Ledger or similar?

53,gmf415i,t3_krqrmf,"Yo-yo guys, I'm quite new to this community and crypto at all, so I would kindly ask you to recommend me an application ,desktop app or mobile (wallet) where I can store my crypto. I know that times are not the best to start buying ETH , BTC but I am thinking of buying each month for around 100$-150$ each as I really believe into those 2 and the idea behind them. So basically I am thinking of **HODL**.

Currently I buy and store my crypto in [Binance.com](https://binance.com/) but I noticed that they will take 0.0005 fee on withdrawal back to a wallet.

My question is: Should I wait to stack some amount (a few months) and then withdraw to my wallet so this way I can reduce the fee cost? And do this on every 2 or 3 months?

Also, is there any kind of fee on the wallet's side that you are going to recommend me?

Thinking of buying some DOT and LTC as well. (as a long-term investment)

Any websites where I can read trustful information about the news around crypto on daily basis or any discord / telegram group?

I predict that people will shill altcoins, that others will predict a crash (or call a temporary dip in value a crash), and that others will say it's a good time to 'stack sats'. I predict that as the value rises, some will post that it's important to be cautious and diversify, that a coming sell wall is going to make the price drop significantly, that they make more by day trading, etc. Someone will post, ""Guys, should I buy now"" and someone else will post, ""Guys, should I sell now."" Someone will tell both of them that they're idiots for seeking financial advice from random redditors (which is correct).

Many of these events will repeat themselves, with variations, throughout the day. Oh, and at least one person will post ""Pamp it.""

why to do DCA for a year if you can go all in now when the price is below ATH ?

218,gmeo6t6,t3_lehiux,"I am so close to understanding hardware wallets, but I just need some assistance to properly 'get it' and wondered if someone can help.

My understanding is, for me to have full ownership/control of my Bitcoin, I must have the private and public keys in my possession. So, with a hardware wallet these keys would be stored on the device's internal memory (rather than controlled by an online wallet or exchange), and I would also have a 12 or 24 word backup/recovery phrase for this as well, in case I lost or destroyed the physical wallet.

The Bitcoin themselves aren't *on* the wallet, as they are all stored on a decentralised blockchain. But the security of the wallet is that I have my keys in order to access them on the blockchain. 

Is that generally right?

What I don't understand, is how can I see what my current Bitcoin amount/value is on the wallet? Do I have to plug it in everytime to look? If I got a Trezor One, would I have something available on my phone (Android) to track this?

Yep, you got it!  

> What I don't understand, is how can I see what my current Bitcoin amount/value is on the wallet?  

Your Trezor connects to their full node and asks it for balance of your addresses (this is a bit of a privacy leak btw, and that's why it is strongly recommended to utilize your own full node for that reason).   

>  Do I have to plug it in everytime to look?  

Not sure how Trezor does this specifically, some wallets utilize the xpub (master public key; the key from which all the addresses are derived) to query balances, some wallets just use single addresses.  

Very generally, it is not necessary to plug in your device every time just to see the balance, but this might involve importing your xpub into another software. This is ok security wise (nobody can steal your coins with just the xpub), but is a privacy risk, because anybody with your xpub will be able to see all your past and future transactions forever.",t3_lehiux,2021-02-07 19:28:02,2021-02-07

The price of a good is the amount of money asked per unit of it. For a constant amount of money, like Bitcoin, and an expanding quantity of goods, prices will actually fall.

Prices will also fall when the rate of increase in the supply of goods exceeds the rate of increase in the money supply. Bitcoin's money supply is fixed and predictable. If the money supply increases by 5% and the quantity of goods increases by 10%, prices will fall by 5%, ceteris paribus.

Think of one bitcoin like 100 million satoshis kind of like how you think about how 100,000 kilos of gold is 100 million grams. Our bitcoin is rarer than gold could ever be. A small piece is still very valuable.

The main reason bitcoin is ""the future of money"" is its decentralized. No regulatory authority can devalue or censor or countetfeit it. Gold, USD, stocks are all susceptible forms of money. Bitcoin is uncrackable for at least 100 years unless computing power advances a billion fold, in which fiat banks are screwed long before.

Everybody tends to like a different thing the most about bitcoin. I like that its a deflationary hedge. Its limited supply will always increase in value against paper money constantly printed. The money I save gains value. My future feels more certain with bitcoin in my wallet.

Bitcoin is still early and it takes a little bit of belief, but the investors have dubbed it a zero risk asset, and you're about to be very late to the party. If you're a corporation you are a year behind. Individuals might not own bitcoin frequently at first, they might actually end up borrowing it.

Bitcoin is going to eat credit cards this way (or join them, like Visa). Normally credit cards require high interest rates around 28%. Loaning against bitcoin however you can charge 5 or 6%. This will be one of the first consumer products that become mass adopted.

You'll have to pay fees to the pool, fees to send it off the wallet and once you finally have some coin in your wallet, 8 months have gone by and bitcoin crashed its actually only $41 after fees. Your computer is fried and useless now. Your roommates are pissed their electricity bill is $400. Sorry.

I try to be open to other's opinion and while I respect them, I can't comprehend why anyone would think it would ever be a replacement. Crypto is a great alternative, and hopefully one day an equal to fiat. I don't get this argument of this or that stance, or why one has to be "" better"" than the other. Yes fiat has it's flaws, but lets face it for every flaw that exists for fiat, there's one if not more to match it for crypto. You know what, that's ok. I invest in both crypto and gold and no way I would ever give up either or for the other all the way.  To each their own, but part of the problem with crypto is well honestly the people who use it. Constantly trying to scream loud how your solution is better will make people ignore you out of spite even if the solution is better. I know I'm one of them. I not not everyone falls into this category but so many I see on this so and so many of my friends of mine follow that mindset and part of the reason I only say that I use crypto if I'm specifically ask. Like many social or economic issues, often times it isn't a problem with the solution, but the problem is with the people who are touting it and trying to cram it in your face that it is better of the "" future"".  I know many who love the idea of crypto, but won't get into it because they can't stand the in your face so many users scream of how fiat is garbage and you are dumb if you invest in it... blah blah blah. I'm somewhat in that category myself, but I just ignore most people I know who use it and seldom discuss it with my friends anymore. To be fair, maybe why so many have this attitude is because the other side is just as guilty.

1085,gmcbhgq,t3_lebyhr,"The question of what could work as money across space civilizations is a fun one.

For example, Star Trek, while presenting a largely money-free system within the federation, also has a concept of a super-rare element named ""latinum"", highly treasured by several civilizations outside of the federation's post-scarcity communist utopia.

What makes the element so universally valuable? That's unclear. It's super rare, and that's about it.  

And that's the extent of Schiff's argument for Gold: It's basically latinum to him.

Meanwhile, in reality as we understand it, Bitcoin is a pretty striking demonstration that money is just another one of our moderns consensual hallucinations.

There isn't any great reason why another space civilization would give a damn about any form of money puny earthlings would use. Unless they want to buy earthling stuff.  

Similarly, we probably wouldn't care about some arbitrary alien money system, unless we could buy cool alien gizmos with it.

All of this points to the likely development of a space-forex system, where various forms of space-money can find their exchange rate, and middle-aliens facilitate swaps between gold, bitcoin, latinum and seashells.",t3_lebyhr,2021-02-07 12:48:07,2021-02-07

That thing that BitCoin has going for it is that its not manipulated and debased like other fiat currencys.  The value behind fiat issued by governments is only as good as the government it represents.  The full faith and credit of any nation is increasingly worth less and less.

If we use Bitcoin, the aliens will have no way of producing it themselves, and whatever Bitcoin they will acquire will be acquired from us in exchange for goods from them. And later they will use that Bitcoin in exchange for goods from us. That’s how trade is supposed to work.

If the today's gold price reflects:

66% store of value use, and 33% of industrial use.

I think you're wrong. Compare apple juice made from concentrate with fresh squeezed apple juice.

From concentrate is like, four or five aspects of flavour, and some sweetness, whereas freshly squeezed apple juice (most, cider, depending on area) has several hundreds individual chemical components that all add an aspect of flavour. We can definitely synthesize something that taste like apples, but synthesizing all of the components would suddenly turn horribly expensive.

If you buy something with fiat, that is money you could have put into Bitcoin.

The currency you use to transact is utterly irrelevent to your gains.

All that matters is how much fiat you hold vs how much Bitcoin you hold.

Also, Laszlo Hanyecz, the dude I assume you're referring to, spent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas. That's not $100k, that's $380m right now.

Except he doesn't regret it, rightly, because of one simple fact: it wasn't millions then. It was the cost of two pizzas. Had anybody put the cost of two pizzas into Bitcoin back then, that would be worth $380m right now. Anyone who bought two pizzas in 2010 with fiat *could* have bought Bitcoin instead.

The opportunity cost exists whether you buy BTC or not. The opportunity cost exists whether you transact in BTC or fiat. Merely holding fiat, let alone spending it, is 'losing' on potential BTC gains. Except that's a fucking idiotic perspective, because people have to spend some of their money to live. The same applies to spending BTC.

If you think BTC is going up big long-term, you should be holding as *little* fiat as possible (considering volatility risk). In this scenario, it makes sense to be transacting in BTC where viable, because doing so will make you more cognisant of your spending. But don't be fooled. Any time you spend fiat, you are taking the same potential loss as if you spent that exact same amount in Bitcoin.

If you're concerned about over-exposure to BTC, you shouldn't be 'diversifying' via fiat holdings, though personally, my COL/income ratio is so low (not because I'm particularly well off, more because I'm a cheap bastard), I'm totally cool being overexposed to BTC and holding only a small fiat emergency fund.",t3_lekw6t,2021-02-07 23:36:27,2021-02-07

There are so many smart men who fail to just read Marx, Veblen, and other left wing socialist, anarchist, and communist economists who do way better explaining how money is a bullshit concept and it evolves over time.  It's obvious that crypto currency has massive potential because it allows the fluidity that so many old school libertarians and socialists argued for.   

Richard Wolff who is probably the most prominent Marxian economist in the US says he has never had more capitalists reaching out to him for advise because the old-school capitalist framework is failing.

Outlawing Bitcoin would require WORLDWIDE cooperation which has literally never happened and even then, outlawing it doesn't stop it..just creates black markets. Government abolition of anything never stops it. 
2. In an apocalyptic situation, no one gives a fuck about gold.

If it disincentivizes reckless indulgence, good, it does so because people care more about their futures and are aware that they are throwing away an appreciating asset. If it disincentivizes reckless entrepreneurship, good, capital will be concentrated in truly productive ventures that contribute value to the lives of a more discerning marketplace. 

These fears are rooted in Keynesian assertions that most people don't have the background or the inclination to question. The celebration of reckless consumption and debt has a lot to do with the degraded state of our culture. We are rapidly depleting the productivity grain-stores of our predecessors. This can't continue on in perpetuity. 

People will continue to consume everything they have to, and prices of things that people only want to consume will drop to accommodate a less prodigal marketplace. Where production is directed in this circumstance will, in my opinion, lead us to the next generation of massive technological leaps of the magnitude we saw through the gold-backed 19th and the turn of the 20th century.",t3_ldvoe8,2021-02-07 15:39:33,2021-02-07

I don't think bitcoin is anywhere near that right now though. I'm thinking it will go well past 50k before the hype builds up and then tons of people will get in again driving the price around 100k or more, then the sell off happens.

Lets take bitcoin as an example, right now theres alot of attention at 40k. So why not take profits amd come back in on the pullback? 

The more attention an asset is getting is a clear indication of a pullback. Most of us here were early and the people hearing about this now in my opinion are late to the party.

To be able to be that it needs a system to store history and its current ownership of coins.

That problem is solved with a mechanism called the blockchain.

Due to its properties this mechanism is very limited useful and money for now is on of the few applications where it has proven to be successful.

I can't say there are no other applications where it can be used successful but I haven't seen any although smart contracts seem to be another.

Combined with more and more interest from the general public, and also thanks to halvening (due to which the rewards for miners go down by half, and the price of BTC goes up), I believe it is safe to assume that the price of BTC will only continue rising.",t3_ldwv5c,2021-02-07 21:59:09,2021-02-07

The only reason it’s considered volatile is because in the short term it rises and falls so often with larger bull runs and bear runs.

This will increase these altchain valuations.
