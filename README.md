**Bitcoin Day Trading Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing** 

With the observation that cryptocurrency prices are heavily influenced by sentiments because they do not have sophisticated real life use cases, coupled with attempts from researchers to incorporate sentiment analysis into machine learning prediction, this project aims to investigate the usefulness of sentiment analysis on Bitcoin day trading on small data sets.

There are a total of five data sources used in this project:
1. Bitcoin-related price information (adjusted close bitcoin price, bitcoin volume, e.g.) extracted from [Yahoo Finance](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/)
2. Macroeconomic factors such as S&P 500 Price, Gold Price and Global Currency Ratios (CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNYÂ  against the US dollar) extracted from [Yahoo Finance](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/)
3. Blockchain information (transactions per block and blockchain hash rates) extracted from [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/)
4. Daily Top 50 Reddit Post and Reddit Comment  Sentiments from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
5. CoinDesk Article Sentiments and volume of posts from [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/)

## Setup

```
Pip
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

2) Activate the virtual environment in your project directory in your terminal 

Conda
```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Pip
```
$ C:\Users\...\project_folder> venv\Scripts\activate
```

3) Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YangYuesong0323/BT4222_repo.git
