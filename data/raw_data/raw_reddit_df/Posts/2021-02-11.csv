3.8 GPA in highschool, but choose not to go to college. Hearing constant scrutiny ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never make what you want to make. You‚Äôll never get a job you enjoy without a degree‚Äù

But I came across bitcoin in 2017 (17 year old), and made my first buy in 2018. I didn‚Äôt understand it at first obviously. But I always had a distrust in the government. Bitcoin opened my eyes to the root of our issues - the broken money. 
Diving down the sound money rabbit hole, libertarianism, and bitcoin in 2018, I was stacking regularly by the end of the year (I‚Äôve had a job since I was 15). 

Much like not going to college, everyone had an opinion about me putting my money in Bitcoin. 
You all know the FUD, it‚Äôs magic money, the govt will ban it, it‚Äôs a ponzi, blah blah blah. 

Fast forward to Feb 2021. 

I‚Äôve helped dozens of people my age, all the way to 68 year old co workers setup a cold storage stack, and a DCA. 
I run my own full node, use multisig, UTXO labeling, all from you fucks. NOBODY in my physical life told me I should look at Bitcoin. NOBODY supported it the first two years. It was you. 
All you people I‚Äôve never met. You all taught me more than what any bullshit fucking university ever would. You gave me the tools and the confidence to lower my time preference and build for my future. Today, I looked at my entire stack for the first time in months. 

It brought me to fucking tears. I cried on the way to the job site this morning like a little fucking princess. Seeing my net worth over 250k really solidified my beliefs. You guys know how insane you feel talking to normies. Week after week. Year after year. You keep convincing yourself you‚Äôre doing the right thing, but you‚Äôre never really 100% certain , wether that be not getting a degree, or putting your life savings into magic internet money. 

I doubt anyone will read this, but thank you. Thank you plebs for keeping me sane through all of this. Thanks to contributors, content creators, core devs, lightning devs. You guys truly are working towards a better and brighter future and it‚Äôs fucking beautiful. 

Never stop spreading the gospel of Satoshi.
