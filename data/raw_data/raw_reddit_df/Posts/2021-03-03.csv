0,Another CoinSwap milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps. Undetectable bitcoin privacy is being built,595,lm6nmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lm6nmk/another_coinswap_milestone_multihop_coinswaps/,188,2021-02-18 06:34:13,"Suppose Alice has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from bitcoin address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z which is entirely unconnected to either A or B.

Now imagine another user, Carol, who isn't too bothered by privacy and sends her bitcoin using a regular wallet. But because Carol's transaction looks exactly the same as Alice's, anybody analyzing the blockchain must now deal with the possibility that Carol's transaction actually sent her coins to a totally unconnected address. So Carol's privacy is improved even though she didn't change her behaviour, and perhaps had never even heard of this software.

In a world where advertisers, social media and other companies want to collect all of Alice's and Carol's data, such privacy improvement would be incredibly valuable. And also the doubt added to every transaction would greatly boost the fungibility of bitcoin and so make it a better form of money.

This undetectable privacy can be developed today by implementing CoinSwap. The software could be standalone as a kind of bitcoin mixing app, but it could also be a library that existing wallets can implement allowing their users to send Bitcoin transactions with much greater privacy.


For the last few months I've been working on implementing this project, and recently reached another milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps.

In the original CoinSwap design there would be only two peers involved, that meant if your wallet did a CoinSwap the other party knew exactly where your coins went. They were a single point of failure in privacy. Multi-hop CoinSwap is where the user routes their coins of multiple CoinSwap peers, and all of them need to collude in order to figure out the final source and destination of the coins.


Just for fun I created a 5-hop CoinSwap on testnet. Each hop has 3 individual transactions:

These transactions don't look particularly special (which is the point), but they are CoinSwaps. Following the CoinSwap protocol, those coins are transferred off-chain to the next market maker. Even though the coin are unspent at the time of writing, they are unilaterally controlled by the other party.

The user created a CoinSwap for 0.05 tBTC in this case (but it could have been any amount), and out the other side they got the same amount of coins (minus a fee) entirely disconnected to their initial coins. The fee goes to the makers which provides them an incentive to cooperate to improve privacy, and also gets spent on miner fees.

From the point of view of someone just passively observing the blockchain, a single-hop CoinSwap is as private as a multi-hop CoinSwap, so I suspect in practice most users will just create 1-hop or 2-hop CoinSwaps.


These example CoinSwaps have a visible 2-of-2 multisig address. But the plan is to later use a protocol called ECDSA-2P which allows us to create 2-of-2 multisig addresses that look the same as regular single-signature addresses. This allows CoinSwaps to blend in with the rest of the bitcoin transactions out there. Even the legacy p2pkh addresses starting with 1 can be CoinSwap addresses.

CoinSwap is the next generation of bitcoin on-chain privacy tech. It improves on CoinJoin because it breaks the transaction graph, and even improves the privacy of people who don't use it. CoinSwap also uses less block space for the same privacy and therefore is cheaper in miner fees.

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year’s near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe’s Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe’s Law, remember?

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow “crypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers’ digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry’s path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin’s processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/t74wwd7edvk61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=86efc9bd3a7aaf40556c7d516779594edc53e884)

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe’s Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

Started working at a crypto mining farm in Jan 2018 and it changed my life. 

My employers asked if I was cool getting paid in bitcoin. At the time, my answer was “As long as I can sell it into Ringgit Malaysia (fiat)”. Got paid around $1k+ monthly - remembered receiving about 0.2 bitcoin monthly. One day, I didnt have to sell all of it because I already have more than enough fiat. So i figured meh Ill just save it for later. That’s when it happened. Bitcoin went up 20% from $3k+ to $4.2k and so did my salary. Kept going up and i kept hodling.

Employers turned out to be greedy dicks and changed their minds towards the end - “we are not paying you in precious BTC anymore”. But my love for crypto remains. 

I was let go shortly after without any compensation and notice after I helped them move their operation to the US where the electricity is a lot lower. Struggled to make ends meet for a little while but doing odd jobs and investing in bitcoin mining got me going. Managed to feed my wife and kid. 

I reinvested mining profits into more machines all around the world with hosting, cloud contracts, and the returns kept compounding. 

Ive never told anyone I have bitcoin except for my wife. I am happily retired at 30 in a country where $200 is a family’s monthly grocery.

28,Making the case for flag day activation of taproot,48,lwvg78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lwvg78/making_the_case_for_flag_day_activation_of_taproot/,76,2021-03-03 22:42:19,"The bitcoin world is close to total gridlock on the question of how to activate taproot. [There's](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018498.html) [no](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018425.html) [agreement](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018427.html) [on](https://medium.com/@sdaftuar/on-taproot-activation-and-consensus-changes-in-bitcoin-5b3453e91c4e) [activation](https://gist.github.com/achow101/3e179501290abb7049de198d46894c7c), and if an agreement isn't reached then nothing happens. That would be really terrible because we'd miss out on the benefits of taproot and potentially other future soft forks.

A major problem with BIP8 is that it would result to a situation where different parts of the bitcoin ecosystem run different consensus rules. Some people will run LOT=true and others LOT=false. Worst of all, it becomes vulnerable to a twitter/reddit/social media blitz which could attempt to move the date of miner activation around.

Twitter and reddit drama provide a perfect cover for social attacks on bitcoin. 

Forced signalling leads to brinksmanship. Where two or more sides (backed up by social media drama) enter into a game of chicken with deployed nodes. If one of them doesn't concede then we get a damaging chain split. And the $1 trillion in value that the bitcoin network protects is put at risk. From the point of view of a miner or big exchange stuck in the middle, if they look at the ecosystem of twitter and reddit (especially if you think about all the problems with bots and sockpuppets) they have no idea which consensus rules they should actually follow and exactly what date they take effect. Miners, exchanges, merchants and the rest of the ecosystem exist to serve their customers and users, and trouble happens when they don't know what their customers really want. Social media attacks are not just a theoretical concern; back during the block size drama, the bitcoin reddits were [targetted by bots](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4biob5/research_into_instantaneous_vote_behavior_in/), [sockpuppets](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/41ykkt/members_trying_to_destroy_bitcoin_on_this_thread/cz6ccka/?context=3) and [brigading](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3v04pd/can_we_please_have_a_civil_discussion_about/cxjnz1d/?context=1).

Enter flag day activation. With a flag day there can be no brinksmanship. A social media blitz cant do anything except have its own followers fork away. Crucially, miner signalling cant be used to change the activation date for nodes that didn't choose to and just passively follow signalling. Changing the activation date requires all those users to actually run different node software.

Flag day activation works simply: we choose a block height and after that block height the new taproot rules become enforced.


Supporters of the permissionless, ""users rule"" approach of LOT=true should be happy because it completely takes miners out of activation.

Supporters of the safe, conservative approach of LOT=false can be made happy with a few ways of derisking:

* Getting mining pools, businesses and users to look at the code and ask if they (a) think its either neutral or good for their business or use case and (b) they believe others view it similarly and that the consensus changes proposed have a good social consensus around them.

* Setting the flag day far in the future (18 months or 2 years in the [original proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018495.html)).


**What if flag day activation is used maliciously?**

What if one day the Core developer team is co-opted and uses the flag day method to do something bad? For example, a soft fork where sending to certain blacklisted addresses is not allowed. The bitcoin user community who wants to resist this can create their own counter-soft-fork full node, where the first block after the flag day MUST pay to one of those addresses on the blacklist. This forces a chain split between the censorship rules and the no-censorship rules, and its pretty obvious that the real bitcoin which most people follow will be the chain without censorship.

For example, if a group of users didn't agree with taproot then they could create their own counter-flag-day-activation which requires that a transaction is included that does an invalid-spend from a taproot output in the first block after the flag day height.

This is always possible with any user activated soft fork. In BIP8 LOT=true it could be done by rejecting block headers with certain version bits signalled.


**But it will take so long!**

We seem to be at a deadlock now. This will take less time than any other method, because other methods might never happen. BIP8 is dead and from what I see there's no other credible plan.

We've already waited years for taproot. I remember listening to talks about bitcoin from 2015 of people discussing Schnorr signatures. And given how slow segwit and p2sh adoption were its pretty likely that we'll waiting a while for taproot to be actually adopted.


**A social media blitz could still try to activate it early**

The brinksmanship only works because miner signalling can make many other nodes activate early, even if those other nodes didn't do anything. There can't be a game of chicken that puts the bitcoin network at risk.

If a group of people did adopt alternative node software which has a shorter flag day, they actually have a risk of slow blocks. Because they cant trick or force any other nodes to come along with them, they are likely to only have a small economy and therefore would lose a lot of hashrate. Imagine trading bitcoins for cash in person and instead of waiting 10 minutes for a confirmation you have to wait 3 hours because the blocks are slow.

Also, the argument for downloading and running a different software only to speed up activation is pretty weak. Taproot would activate in ~18 months, so why are you so impatient that you need it in 6 months? And risk slow blocks for you while doing so? The big difference with BIP148 the segwit UASF, is that people *had to* run some other software otherwise they would get *no soft fork at all*.


**Without miner signalling how do we know the new rules are even activated?**

When did you see miners signalling their support for the inflation schedule?

Bitcoin's rules are enforced by wallets backed by full nodes. You'll always know if your own full node is enforcing the new rules. The thing that matters isnt miner signalling but your own full node, and the nodes of those you trade with.

Flag day activation is quite similar to the way block reward halvenings work. At and after block height 630000 miners are only allowed to create 6.25 BTC rather than 12.5 BTC. Everyone knows that if miners continued to create 12.5 BTC or more they would be unable to sell or spend those coins anywhere.

In 2017 when segwit was being activated people created a huge list of various bitcoin companies, merchants and wallets: https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111943/https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/ Looking at that list, you would know that if someone stole coins from a segwit address they would be unable to deposit them in many exchanges and merchants: Bitrefill, Bitstamp, Kraken, Localbitcoins, Paxful, Vaultoro, HitBTC, etc.

Then what happened is only a month after S2X was beaten this guy moved 40000 BTC to a segwit address, confident about the power of the network to protect his coins.
https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7tcmi4/bitcointalks_famous_user_loaded_moved_his_40k_btc/

If there's ever any doubt about flag day activation we can always draw up a similar list, although if there's broad consensus about it then there's no reason why bitcoin businesses wouldn't upgrade to the latest Core, like they did with every other previous soft fork.


**This gives the impression that Core developers control the protocol**

This objection has a mirror image argument: BIP8 with LOT=false gives the impression that miners control the protocol(!)

Eventually some group has to make a decision. We will ask the bitcoin economy and users what they think of flag day activation. It's pretty clear that nobody seriously objects to taproot, and as described above if Core developers did something evil the community could resist it with a counter-flag-day-activation.



**TL;DR**

I believe flag day activation is the way forward. It should answer all the objections and risks which make other methods too controversial. Let's go ahead and bring taproot to bitcoin!",2021-03-03

seemingly intelligent people (the latest of which is michael burry) speak disparagingly of bitcoin with an astonishingly high level of confidence that they're right about bitcoin being bad/pointless/overpriced/etc. for the life of me, I can't figure out why can't see at least the partial usefulness of bitcoin and everything that it is.

But one thought: bitcoin is so novel, so groundbreaking, so innovative, that people can't even see it. they can't see it in the way an ant can't see a smartphone (ok, exaggerating, but still). they're so thoroughly entranced by the high-time-preference, high-entropy, central-authority-stockholm-syndrome default worldview, that they don't even see the things that bitcoin fixes as problems.

for them, the world where wealth slowly slips away through entropy, or is only preserved through the debt-fueled frenetic activity of a public tech company or by loaning it back to a central authority with a military, (or rather than preserved, simply received continually as a gift by virtue of one's proximity to a fiat money printer), is the only possible world that can exist.

I think about it this way: most people are so high time preference, so focused on the short term, so involved in high frequency, high risk, frenetic active hedging and trading strategies in business and in life, that that is the only world they can conceive of. Enter bitcoin, a deceptively simple, long term, stable, low frequency, low time preference savings technology, they can't even see it.

Their time preference is so high, and bitcoin is designed for people whose time preference is so low, that for them bitcoin just doesn't exist in any meaningful way. they see people interacting with it but can't understand their behavior.

so instead they just try to fit into framings they can understand....""bubble"", ""ponzi"", ""greedy waste of energy""
