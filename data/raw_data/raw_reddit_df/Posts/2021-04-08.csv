12,Some pretty amazing developments are happening in bitcoin technology...,46,mn39fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mn39fm/some_pretty_amazing_developments_are_happening_in/,10,2021-04-09 06:30:04,"While we see a lot of Bitcoin news in mainstream media, one thing that often gets overlooked is the developments made to improve the technology. 

Bitcoin technology saw major developments and upgrades in the past year \[2020\] and has some promising updates coming in 2021. 

# [2020]

**Lightning Network:**

One of the key developments within the Lightning Network in 2020 has been Watchtowers, which makes the protocol more secure.

One of Lightning Networks' drawbacks is that it made it possible for users to cheat and claim more funds than actually allocated to them. The partner user can stop this from happening but it requires continued monitoring of the bitcoin blockchain.

To avoid this, [Watchtower](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/watchtowers/) was implemented which allows channel monitoring to be outsourced to impartial observers.

**Taproot:**

Taproot is supposed to be a major upgrade to the bitcoin protocol which would bring about huge improvements to the bitcoin‚Äôs scalability, fungibility, & privacy.

Taproot would essentially make smart contracts look like regular bitcoin transactions, thanks to [Schnorr signature](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496), 

Using this will greatly reduce the transaction size giving room for more transactions on the block and increase privacy.

Taproots activation has been a topic of discussion for the past couple of months and various activation and consensus mechanisms are being tested.

**PayJoin and CoinSwap:**

PayJoin and CoinSwap are two protocols that were designed to increase the privacy of bitcoin transactions.

Currently, bitcoin transactions are not exactly private they are pseudo-anonymous, meaning with a little tracking they can be traced back to the user.

With [PayJoin, or Pay to EndPoint \[P2EP\]](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/payjoin/), the user sends funds to themselves while also receiving funds from the actual receiver. This tricks anyone tracking the funds to think that all the funds belong to the same person when in fact that is not the case. 

**Vaults**

[Bitcoin Vaults](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/vaults/) are a type of smart contract that will require bitcoin transactions several confirmations and a time delay to actually be spent.

This will time for the potential victim to reverse the transaction and get back the stolen bitcoins.

**Smart Contracts - DLC**

This update, designed for smart contracts, will bring about a change in how they operate when they rely on external data \[data that does not live on the blockchain\]. 

**MINSC**

 A Miniscript-based scripting language for Bitcoin contracts, MINSC would greatly simplify the creation of bitcoin transactions. 

# [2021]

**Bech32m**

It is expected that Bech32m will support Taproot and all future segwit based script updates. 

**Private Key** 

This [feature](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21201) will add an update to the bitcoin wallets through which users will not be able to send transaction(s) from their wallet if the private key is disabled. 

**Multiple fee rate request**

This [update](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21083) would bring about a change to the fee rate selection process that happens during the coin selection. It would essentially avoid coin selection from failing.

(Which means private keys will mean nothing and bitcoin can be distributed freely by anyone with access to such computing power.)

As far as I can tell, the only ledger that deals with this head on is QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger,) otherwise it seems to be a ridiculed non-issue for most hodlers.

The answers I have gotten for asking this is usually something along the lines of:

""Quantum computing is like cold fusion; the technology of the future that never actually happens."" I disagree. [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/the-current-state-of-quantum-computing-between-hype-and-revolution](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/the-current-state-of-quantum-computing-between-hype-and-revolution)

""If RSA Encryption breaks, Bitcoin will be the last of our problems."" I disagree, bitcoin seems like a great target to take advantage of  without destroying the world.

""Someone is already working on this threat, dont worry about it, it will be fixed, just hodl, buy the dip etc etc"" Who? What exactly is being done?

""Its just FUD, leave me alone."" Ok, fine, I will ask someone who actually thinks about this instead.

Is there any documentation of what is *actually* being done to prepare bitcoin (and others) for the seemingly inevitable destruction of RSA encryption?

OR  

2. Run a lightning node (improve 2nd-layer scalability)

I understand that the answer to this question can shift as these networks mature, so I'd like to know which use case would be better for Bitcoin as of Q2, 2021 and why?

Thanks!",2021-04-09

Anyway, was rewatching one of the Big Think videos and listening to Michio Kaku talk about Type I, II, III civilizations on the Kardashev scale and how we're advancing towards a type I civilization. 

He mentions the internet being a Type 1 telephone system and English being a Type I planetary language amongst other examples. Then it struck me, Bitcoin could potentially be the birth of our Type I monetary system for the planet bringing us one step closer to reaching a full Type I Civilization status (assuming humans don't destroy each other before we get there). Anyway, thought I would share it in case it might strike the same thought in anyone else too.
