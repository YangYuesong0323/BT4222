1,Another CoinSwap milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps. Undetectable bitcoin privacy is being built,168,lm6nmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lm6nmk/another_coinswap_milestone_multihop_coinswaps/,61,2021-02-18 06:34:13,"Suppose Alice has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from bitcoin address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z which is entirely unconnected to either A or B.

Now imagine another user, Carol, who isn't too bothered by privacy and sends her bitcoin using a regular wallet. But because Carol's transaction looks exactly the same as Alice's, anybody analyzing the blockchain must now deal with the possibility that Carol's transaction actually sent her coins to a totally unconnected address. So Carol's privacy is improved even though she didn't change her behaviour, and perhaps had never even heard of this software.

In a world where advertisers, social media and other companies want to collect all of Alice's and Carol's data, such privacy improvement would be incredibly valuable. And also the doubt added to every transaction would greatly boost the fungibility of bitcoin and so make it a better form of money.

This undetectable privacy can be developed today by implementing CoinSwap. The software could be standalone as a kind of bitcoin mixing app, but it could also be a library that existing wallets can implement allowing their users to send Bitcoin transactions with much greater privacy.


For the last few months I've been working on implementing this project, and recently reached another milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps.

In the original CoinSwap design there would be only two peers involved, that meant if your wallet did a CoinSwap the other party knew exactly where your coins went. They were a single point of failure in privacy. Multi-hop CoinSwap is where the user routes their coins of multiple CoinSwap peers, and all of them need to collude in order to figure out the final source and destination of the coins.


Just for fun I created a 5-hop CoinSwap on testnet. Each hop has 3 individual transactions:

These transactions don't look particularly special (which is the point), but they are CoinSwaps. Following the CoinSwap protocol, those coins are transferred off-chain to the next market maker. Even though the coin are unspent at the time of writing, they are unilaterally controlled by the other party.

The user created a CoinSwap for 0.05 tBTC in this case (but it could have been any amount), and out the other side they got the same amount of coins (minus a fee) entirely disconnected to their initial coins. The fee goes to the makers which provides them an incentive to cooperate to improve privacy, and also gets spent on miner fees.

From the point of view of someone just passively observing the blockchain, a single-hop CoinSwap is as private as a multi-hop CoinSwap, so I suspect in practice most users will just create 1-hop or 2-hop CoinSwaps.


These example CoinSwaps have a visible 2-of-2 multisig address. But the plan is to later use a protocol called ECDSA-2P which allows us to create 2-of-2 multisig addresses that look the same as regular single-signature addresses. This allows CoinSwaps to blend in with the rest of the bitcoin transactions out there. Even the legacy p2pkh addresses starting with 1 can be CoinSwap addresses.

CoinSwap is the next generation of bitcoin on-chain privacy tech. It improves on CoinJoin because it breaks the transaction graph, and even improves the privacy of people who don't use it. CoinSwap also uses less block space for the same privacy and therefore is cheaper in miner fees.

I'm a professional with a job outside the finance industry. I earn around €40,000 a year. I don't have a large collection of assets - just a regular guy who bought some Bitcoin in 2019 with savings.   


Bitpanda has frozen my funds and is refusing to allow me to withdraw them on the excuse of new EU anti-money laundering rules. They have asked me to obtain proof of funds which I did, but they also want me to obtain the credit card receipts and notes from my bank of my crypto-currency purchase in 2019. I moved my Bitcoin out and in of the exchange several times, using Blockfi or trading it on Binance, and they are assuming I have cumulatively more than 100% of Bitcoin than I ever held just because I did these transactions. The amount of documentation they are asking is huge. It is unreasonable and is intended to only make sure you never get your funds back. My funds are barely half of my yearly salary so we are not speaking of a big amount.   


To cut a long story short I am fully complying with their demands and I am being very cooperative and very polite, however, the anti-money laundering rules which I read do not go this far and Bitpanda is making a lot of theatre with the excuse of holding our funds.   


This is the first time ever that a bank or an entity is acting this way with my money - holding it hostage against unreasonable demands. Although the staff is polite - I have no backing and help from them at all and they are simply making assumptions I had more Bitcoin than I did and sticking to their assumptions without helping me go through this. They don't care about our money and this is developing into a real-time nightmare.   


I thought I would be safe if I deposited by Bitcoin in a European-based entity. I was wrong.   


This is the last time ever I will use Bitpanda. It is unimaginable financial warfare we have to go through to protect and secure our legally-obtained assets and savings. I was wrong thinking that putting my Bitcoin in a European-based entity was safe. It is not. It is very dangerous. I will not be making the same mistake again.",2021-02-26

1. The obvious, people get checks people spend said check on Bitcoin. More Demand= price goes up (in simplistic terms) this is good timing as we’re currently consolidating and forming a solid floor of around 50-45k give or take which means we should be ready for another nice little bull run. 

2. Right now evidently stock prices are inflated. Even with the pullback the entire market is inflated as result of long standing bailouts and relief packages for big companies. As of right now all this extra money the fed printed and distributed has gone to the big corporations and in turn into their stock price causing it to shoot up. This inflation hasn’t affected any “normal people” yet because the amount of actual stimulus money said normal people have received is a fraction of the amount that the fed has printed and distributed to big corps. When the stimulus starts to hit (many many billions of dollars) this is when inflation actually kicks in as now this money is being properly injected into the economy (albeit likely for rent and groceries which hands much back to larger corporations) but it still will be at least partially used to purchase goods of a limited quantity. More money circulates the economy and eventually actual inflation will occur. This is part of the benefit of Bitcoin as it is a hedge against inflation. People will see the inflation and see the benefit of Bitcoin snd will eventually come join the good side.

Let’s face it, there is no real way to know what the value of Bitcoin should be. There is know magical equation to say what the price should be. 

Simply put the price should be what the price is.

My dad is very traditional when it comes to financing. I have been talking about Bitcoin so much and he was very skeptical at first. I tried to educate him for a whole year , sending him links, pages, blogs that talked about Bitcoin but seemed that he ignored all of them. I never gave up and brought it up every time we talked together, showed him my investment and how it kept growing. I used my final card and that was my mom. My dad was fully convinced and i just signed him up for a coinbase account.  He’s 50 and about to start this journey and i am very excited for him.

42,Looking for Anti-Bitcoin reading,13,lt3zlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lt3zlj/looking_for_antibitcoin_reading/,16,2021-02-27 02:14:56,"Probably a weird post, but I'm looking for recommendations of websites/blogs/social media accounts etc. that are anti-bitcoin. Preferably resources that enlist actual research and are not just opinion based rants.

I've been a moderate bitcoin enthusiast since 2016, slowly building a modest portfolio of what was essentially play money, or not at all a significant portion of my net worth. More recently I've gotten into actually researching and reading about the technology to better educate myself, and I can only say that 'I saw the light'. I am a hardcore believer now. But I'm becoming a bit nervous of some thoughts my newly found bitcoin zeal has lead me to. I'm seriously considering liquidating some big portions of my equities investments and long term retirement accounts in order to go heavy into bitcoin. Ultimately, i don't want to do anything too rash, and I fear that everything I've been reading lately that is so pro-bitcoin could be causing too much of an echo-chamber effect on me. So I'm looking for some anti-bitcoiners to temper my excitement a bit; I'm sure it won't change my outlook on bitcoin's future, but I need that cold shower effect right now.",2021-02-27

47,Cognitive Dissonance from Poor Conceptualization,4,lt9fjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lt9fjt/cognitive_dissonance_from_poor_conceptualization/,2,2021-02-27 06:20:56,"We often use metaphors to conceptualize things that have no physical existence, like software, networking and digital systems.  A good metaphor allows us to accurately intuit the behavior of the thing it's meant to represent while a poor metaphor will break down as the thing fails to behave as expected, also known as cognitive dissonance.

In the case of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, we call the applications we use to track our coins 'wallets'. The function of an actual wallet is to hold cash, leading many people to intuit that their 'coins' are like paper bills, but they're not. Coins are stored on the blockchain.

A better metaphor is to imagine the blockchain is a bank full of lock boxes that contain our coins and what we keep are the key's to our lock boxes. This naturally leads us to the more accurate metaphor of a keychain. Our wallet apps are better conceptualized as keychains, I think.",2021-02-27

I have literally gone months without even looking at the current value. In 2018 I had no clue it had dipped below 4k.

2) This was always a long play for me...buy and hold...for years...not weeks or months. This isn't a get rich quick game for me...that being said I will likely be able to retire a few years early because of it.

3) Bitcoin isn't going to zero at this stage. If you don't know why that's true, then you don't understand network effects and Metcalfe's law. If it's not going to zero its going to go a LOT higher. 

4) It's not going to get banned in the US. It will get regulated. Thats a good thing. That will bring in even more institutional investors. Regulation means ""legitimacy"".

5) Central bank digital currencies are coming. They will have no negative impact on BTC...they will likely drive it even higher by introducing even more people to the concept of digital money.

6) If this goes where I know its going...I'll never need to sell. I'll take collateralized loans against it and earn interest off it. Neither creates a tax event and both allow me to keep all my Sats.",2021-02-26
