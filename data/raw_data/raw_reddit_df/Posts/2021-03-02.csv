0,Another CoinSwap milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps. Undetectable bitcoin privacy is being built,529,lm6nmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lm6nmk/another_coinswap_milestone_multihop_coinswaps/,177,2021-02-18 06:34:13,"Suppose Alice has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from bitcoin address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z which is entirely unconnected to either A or B.

Now imagine another user, Carol, who isn't too bothered by privacy and sends her bitcoin using a regular wallet. But because Carol's transaction looks exactly the same as Alice's, anybody analyzing the blockchain must now deal with the possibility that Carol's transaction actually sent her coins to a totally unconnected address. So Carol's privacy is improved even though she didn't change her behaviour, and perhaps had never even heard of this software.

In a world where advertisers, social media and other companies want to collect all of Alice's and Carol's data, such privacy improvement would be incredibly valuable. And also the doubt added to every transaction would greatly boost the fungibility of bitcoin and so make it a better form of money.

This undetectable privacy can be developed today by implementing CoinSwap. The software could be standalone as a kind of bitcoin mixing app, but it could also be a library that existing wallets can implement allowing their users to send Bitcoin transactions with much greater privacy.


For the last few months I've been working on implementing this project, and recently reached another milestone: Multi-hop CoinSwaps.

In the original CoinSwap design there would be only two peers involved, that meant if your wallet did a CoinSwap the other party knew exactly where your coins went. They were a single point of failure in privacy. Multi-hop CoinSwap is where the user routes their coins of multiple CoinSwap peers, and all of them need to collude in order to figure out the final source and destination of the coins.


Just for fun I created a 5-hop CoinSwap on testnet. Each hop has 3 individual transactions:

These transactions don't look particularly special (which is the point), but they are CoinSwaps. Following the CoinSwap protocol, those coins are transferred off-chain to the next market maker. Even though the coin are unspent at the time of writing, they are unilaterally controlled by the other party.

The user created a CoinSwap for 0.05 tBTC in this case (but it could have been any amount), and out the other side they got the same amount of coins (minus a fee) entirely disconnected to their initial coins. The fee goes to the makers which provides them an incentive to cooperate to improve privacy, and also gets spent on miner fees.

From the point of view of someone just passively observing the blockchain, a single-hop CoinSwap is as private as a multi-hop CoinSwap, so I suspect in practice most users will just create 1-hop or 2-hop CoinSwaps.


These example CoinSwaps have a visible 2-of-2 multisig address. But the plan is to later use a protocol called ECDSA-2P which allows us to create 2-of-2 multisig addresses that look the same as regular single-signature addresses. This allows CoinSwaps to blend in with the rest of the bitcoin transactions out there. Even the legacy p2pkh addresses starting with 1 can be CoinSwap addresses.

CoinSwap is the next generation of bitcoin on-chain privacy tech. It improves on CoinJoin because it breaks the transaction graph, and even improves the privacy of people who don't use it. CoinSwap also uses less block space for the same privacy and therefore is cheaper in miner fees.

I will attempt to write as much of it down here (I'm curious to hear your thoughts and whether you agree or think I'm a mad man), but we had so many interesting ideas that I wish I had it on video or some shit. 

Basically, we are big stock guys who dabbled in bitcoin, but have never fully committed. But after this, we are 100% on board. 

So basically, as you know, retail investing has been on the rise. More and more people have begun investing, and they are only beginning to realize the power they have. You don't need go be a billionaire to invest, and honestly the whole system is kind of bullshit. People claim stock prices are built on ""fundamentals"" and they are to some extent. But every stock has INTRINSIC value (the ""fundamentals"", EPS, value for having a successful business, ect) and extrinsic value (hype, speculation on future, ect) This whole GME thing has made people realize that. They banded together and moved a market, sticking it to the guys at the top. However, trading was halted, and with malicious intent or not, Robinhood and its billionaire investors halted trading, ending the retail revolution. 

So, now that people realize that stocks are bullshit with whatever value we collectively place on them, and that they have power in numbers... what is the logical conclusion?

BITCOIN

More and more people will realize that decentralized finance is better in every way. It's sticking it to the government, not allowing them to manipulate and control every aspect of the financial system. If everyone just holds, everyone could be rich, and bitcoin could begin to rival the US dollar, with investors who got in relatively early being rich like all the hedge funds. Unlike in the stock market, no institution could halt trading, meaning there is literally no way bitcoin could be rejected. It's like the snowball effect. It will just keep getting bigger and bigger as it gains more institutional and retail support. 

For part two of our theory, we realized that after our last president showed just how influential social media can be to politics, it is only a matter of time before someone runs for office on the platform of  Bitcoin and decentralized finance. Because decentralized finance would benefit everyone in the country, it could be a wildly popular opinion, and even a way forward into the future. All it takes is for this OBVIOUS idea of someone tying bitcoin to politics to happen. 

Anyways, am I crazy? Or did the universe actually give me reasons that bitcoin cannot fail?",2021-03-02

This is called a Seed Phrase. You must write this down (preferably on a [metal plate](https://shop.cobo.com/products/cobo-tablet-punch)) and keep it in a secure location. Ideally, have two copies in two separate geographic locations.

The 24 word seed phrase is, essentially, your Bitcoin. DO NOT LOSE THIS.

But to be really secure, you should also ***memorize*** the 24 word seed phrase. It doesn't take much time at all; maybe 1 hour or so. Just repeat the words (silently) over and over until they're burned into your brain. I recite them in my mind every time I brush my teeth, so that's twice a day.

This way, if for some reason I'm forced to leave the country immediately and I can't take my wallet or my metal plate with the backup words, I can just leave without hesitation. All my Bitcoin is stored in my mind. Once I reach safety, all I need is a new wallet, I input the 24 word seed phrase, and BAM! I have access to my coins.

Remember to NEVER enter your 24 word seed phrase into any computer, website, or digital device. If you do, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR BITCOIN. You must only enter it into your own personal wallet.

I have tried to use the Judicial System to destroy the bitlicense. I use to have a small business called Chino Ltd and I failed *(there is a link on my old business to all the details on that failed lawsuit but that is not the point of this post.)*

I have called the current politicians over the corruption and I will bring out the Bitlicense and if that what they plan to do with the Decriminalization of Marijuana.

Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, is ready to invest in Bitcoin if its volatility declines and liquidity increases. The fund’s director of investment research told Bloomberg TV about this in an interview. According to her, now the value of the main digital coin may fluctuate in the range of 10% because of publications on Twitter. Bitcoin’s volatility is ten times higher than that of the U.S. dollar. She is confident that such a volatility rate is not suitable for most institutional investors.

Another problem of bitcoin is low liquidity, Bridgewater Associates representative said. According to Patterson, it is possible to increase this indicator by creating a regulatory ecosystem to ensure comfortable work with cryptocurrencies for investors.

>*“The more a real regulated ecosystem is developed around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the more other types of investors will start to get comfortable with crypto assets. That will bring liquidity. It will reduce volatility,” the expert explained.*

At the end of January this year, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, changed his attitude towards cryptocurrency. He wrote about it in the company’s daily newsletter, which is sent to the fund’s clients. Dalio said that in the future bitcoin could become an asset “similar to gold” and stated his willingness to invest in the main digital coin a sum of money that he wouldn’t be sorry to lose.
