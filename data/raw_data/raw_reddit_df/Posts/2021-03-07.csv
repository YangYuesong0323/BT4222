- 3months activation period, 90% hashrate threshold
- if activated, schnorr enablement is 6mo after start
- if not activated, try something else

the longer enablement delay after activation is interesting and reduces the risk from unupgraded nodes on services, miners, wallets, users and gives them time (a risk otherwise increased by short activation window)

while the short activation period avoids delays or perceived indecision resulting in a user-led UASF as SPDY8 is ""fast enough"", and if the unexpected were to happen and miners unreasonably delayed, then it should be easier to find consensus on a flag height activation from there. (actually not clear if BIP 8 or BIP 9, I think BIP 8 is considered an improvement due to use of block heights vs dates which created some subtle problem in the past).",2021-03-06

- Banks are recommending investors to get +1% of their assets in btc

- From corporations to small businesses are moving some of their liquidity to btc.

- We are still waiting for the big 4 big to make a move: Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. These 4 can-not-afford-to-be-left-out and when they get in, that will be the real start of adoption.

We can not predict the market, they want your coins, they want you to FOMO a little bit and buy in, then the Whales will dump a bit to make you fear and sell your coins, and the big players will keep buying at discount.

I'm someone who didn't learn about finance before Bitcoin. I wasted a lot of money and never really thought about how to manage money properly.

&#x200B;

A while back I tried to talk to a family member about Bitcoins and why I think it's a good thing.

I got super stupid answers and this person had no interest in listening to me even once.

I gave facts why Bitcoin is the future and they still don't want to listen to me, make me out to be an idiot who doesn't know anything about anything and is going to fall flat on his face anyway because I wasn't really good with money in the past.

Since one would like to help one and is then looked at so stupidly.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I started another topic. I'm currently looking at a lot of things about our financial system and have decided for myself to have as little cash as possible and rather put it into real estate, bitcoins or other useful investments. That's why I spoke to this family member again, to get another person's opinion on what I'm trying to do.

There I was once again left wondering if I have any idea about these things and they think it won't work anyway.

&#x200B;

I have made many mistakes in the past. Now I'm trying to work on it and use my money wisely, because I think that the system is slowly collapsing.

&#x200B;

I'm getting so fed up with it. I don't think I will share a single word about my finances with my family anymore as I don't feel like discussing it.

&#x200B;

I am still quite ""young"", have done many things wrong, disappointed many and yet learned from those mistakes.

&#x200B;

To be honest I hope she will stay so stubborn and will be really angry in the future for not listening to me.

I think Bitcoin is still going to be a very big thing and believe that we are still in the beginning with just $50,000.

The traded amount in USD is constant weekly, around 4-5 million USD. Just as reference in February 2019 almost 2,500 BTC were traded in one week. I don't think the drop is to worry.

This is measure ONLY using LocalBitcoin (Trades there are mostly Bolivares to BTC and BTC to Bolivares). Months ago Binance started P2P trades with Venezuelan bolivares, I think some people migrated there (it lets you trade other cryptos). Also AirTM is used as exchange too.

Who trades BTC to Bolivares? People that needs to pay in some places where crypto is not accepted. Where do these BTC come from? Could be miners, could be people abroad that send money to their families in Venezuela, could be the goverment itself (sadly), people with crypto savings, etc.

Who trades Bolivares to BTC? People that gets insane amounts of Bolivares (like store owners), people that get paid in Bolivares, and want to convert them in something better and stable than Bolivares digitally and easy.

Two days ago goverment announced the newest bank note (bill) biggest bill in Venezuelan history 1,000,000 Bolivares that is 0.52 USD (as for now)

A big chunk of the population that works for the goverment have a monthly wage of around 1-10 monthly minium wages, monthly minimum wage is around 1.2 USD. So that would put that people from 1.2 to 12 USD monthly. Sadly this people cannot even think in crypto, they are thinking in something different that is survive.

According to a NGO (CENDAS) a 5 members family need around 350 USD monthly to ""live"", yes if you are from USA, Canada, Australia, Germany that amount is ridiculous low, but that is a standar in Latin America, problem more that what you need to spend are the WAGES, they are crazy low. A really good wage here is around 400 USD monthly (in my opion).

If  you want to know something ask me  anything. Here the economy is a mess,  so many poor people and a lot of  people surviving and of course people living ""good""! I have gotten even work from some redditors  since I started posting here, what a  great community.

And MOONS (cryptocurrency subreddit), wow, have helped me a lot (Sadly I have to cash out usually).

One monthly minimum wage is around 18 MOONS.

Starting today, anytime I am craving a coffee or energy drink (usually everyday) instead of running to the store to grab one, I will instead invest that same amount of money (usually around $5 coffee) into BTC. 

My hope in doing this is that it will motivate me to finally cut caffeine and excess sugar from my diet, while also helping me save/build my wealth over time. 

I’m hoping this will also inspire others to take on a similar type of strategy in order to flip a negative habit into a positive one and ultimately improve their lives in the process.

I think what you are seeing right now is massive denial of what's going on with our economy.

The economy has been battered. Small businesses are failing. Americans now have ""huge savings"" after receiving thousands of dollars of stimulus and no bars/movie theaters/restaurants to spend it on. Mall bankruptcies are epic.

The federal reserve is pretending inflation doesn't exist, but if it does exist, they have ways to deal with it. Sure they do.

We are going to see the middle class nearly disappear in the next 10 years. Are you ready for what that looks like? But before then, are you ready for the ""growth"" aka stimulus fueled inflation. Are you ready for real inflation with suppressed interest rates? How about the infrastructure bill of $2 trill.

Is it natural market movement, always aware of the lower max cap, is it somehow tied to the current stacks available on exchanges, regardless of how much still could be mined in the future or might there be ""a moment of realization"" where the actual lower max cap gets closely predicted, driving the price further up when realizing bitcoin has been valued too cheaply because of ""forgetting"" about the lost coins?",2021-03-08

42,Is there a website that keeps track of exchange fees?,5,m01ehh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m01ehh/is_there_a_website_that_keeps_track_of_exchange/,6,2021-03-08 06:32:26,"Hey guys,

Are there any websites that keep track of trading fees on exchanges?

Seeing a ton of people recommend Coinbase Pro as an exchange for newcomers even though their fees are a lot higher than competitors (BinanceUS for example).

Does a website exist that aggregates all this info?

You can put in the amount of BTC you want to purchase, and the website will tell you what the best exchange is?

I tried googling, but all the search results were out of date.

If it doesn't exist I'll build one myself.

Thanks!",2021-03-08

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the lives of citizens worldwide, and this has everything to do with tech startups such as Cloud Nine Education Group Ltd. (CSE: CNI), (OTC: CLGUF). The Vancouver company recently acquired user-friendly mining software from Limitless Technologies; plug and play digital tools that allow for financial sovereignty. 

The acquisition of this mining software coincides with the global pandemic and economic uncertainty. In a world of fiat money, citizens are finally turning to cryptocurrencies instead. This year the company expects to benefit from increased bitcoin prices which has already triggered an increased demand for its software products.

I’m a little older than them and more established financially. I did not ask or expect them to pay me back, but they all insisted.

My compromise: I told them all to take that money (a little over $100) and put it into Bitcoin. I told them they could pay me back once the value has doubled, but I’m actually just going to let them keep it.

This same strategy could be used in a variety of circumstances.",2021-03-08
