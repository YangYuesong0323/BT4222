You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)
* [Video 1: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://youtu.be/ONvg9SbauMg?t=1)
* [Video 2: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=272s)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://youtu.be/JIxwTx7o_B4?t=1)
* [Video 4: Bitcoin Macro Strategy - Michael Saylor & Ross Stevens](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit/sessions/bitcoin-macro-strategy?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ)
* [Video 5: The Saylor Series - Michael Saylor & Robert Breedlove](https://youtu.be/4rvTppy1qLI?t=1)
* [Video 6: Bitcoin S2FX, S2F and Evolution From Collectible to Financial Asset - Stephan Livera, PlanB & Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2cP8k_QUaw)


Some other great resources include [Michael Saylor's ""Bitcoin for Everybody"" course](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468), Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical), and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s).  Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  

If you are technically or academically inclined check out [developer resources](https://developer.bitcoin.org/) and peer-reviewed [research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg), course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) as well as future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  Some Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [here](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/) and [here](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/).  MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial bitcoin integration.

You can see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) or [what you could have earned if you didn't listen to them](https://dontbuybitcointheysaid.com/) XD

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin created and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you how much time until the next drop in block rewards.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the lightning network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

* [Cash app](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [P2P exchange list](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) (decentralized) 

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/).  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""** meaning if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Common Bitcoin Myths

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://getumbrel.com/).  You can view the [global node distribution](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/) for a visual representation of the node network.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in recent Electrum wallet releases
bit | bit | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin (μBTC)
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100k sats

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Disclaimer: I'm not your financial advisor, do your own research, yadda, yadda.

# BITCOIN, THE LONGEST CHAIN

First, we have to establish: Why Bitcoin, specifically?

After all, there are a lot of options out there. This new technology has spawned a vast ecosystem, and it can be daunting to figure out which cryptocurrencies to support.

The answer lies in one of the fundamental conventions of our community: **the** **longest chain rule**. I won't get into the technical details, but in very simplified terms, it means you should support **the most** **popular one**. That one will generally have the most consensus among miners and therefore be the most secure and have the widest support.

You will hear of forks, splits, altcoins, and myriad other things. It's fine to support tech you believe in. But if you understand nothing else, just remember: go with the biggest, most popular one. 

Right now that is Bitcoin.

# BITCOIN, THE LEDGER

There is a lot of complexity behind Bitcoin. It is easy to get lost in all of the technical details.

Let me make it simple: Bitcoin is a **ledger**. It is a **book with numbers in it**. To understand what gives Bitcoin value, you need to understand what gives a ledger value.

A good ledger is **balanced**. All the numbers add up. Every account is correct. You can trust it.

A good ledger is **secure**. You cannot change accounts you do not own. You cannot fudge numbers. You cannot hide anything. You cannot counterfeit anything. You cannot invent new value out of thin air.

A good ledger is **redundant**. There are many copies, and they all agree. There is no single point of failure.

A good ledger is **available**. You can access it from anywhere and synchronize it across borders in the blink of an eye. 

Bitcoin is all of these things and probably more.

When people say Bitcoin is better than fiat, they are talking about Bitcoin, the ledger. When governments print fiat at an alarming rate, it fails the **secure** condition—new value is being invented out of thin air. Likewise, it also fails the **secure** condition when the government is able to forcefully confiscate it—they are changing accounts they do not own. When central banks practice quantitative easing or fractional reserve banking, it fails the **balanced** condition—the numbers don't add up. And when governments restrict you from doing business with countries they do not approve of, it fails the **available** condition. Etc, etc.

Bitcoin does not suffer from any of these problems.

# BITCOIN, THE AGREEMENT

Now, a secure ledger is a worthy thing, but at the end of the day, it is just a book. What use is a book if no one **agrees to use it**?

It is like a parent giving a child an IOU. The IOU has no intrinsic value. To anyone outside the parent and the child, the IOU is worthless. This is why people say Bitcoin is worthless and has no value—they don't accept it. So they are right, in a way. But to the parent and the child, who have **agreed to use it**, the IOU does have worth.

I should point out here that *all* fiat money operates on this principle. It is why I can give the grocery store my US Dollars—they have **agreed to use it**. If someone gave me Korean Won, I would not value it highly because no one I know has **agreed to use it**. I would have to go out of my way to find someone who does **agree to use** Korean Won so I could arrange to trade my Won for their US Dollars, since that is my particular brand of IOU.

Bitcoin is no different. It only has worth to the people who **agree to use it**. It is a secure, trustworthy ledger. You either **agree to use it**, or you don't. The more people who **agree to use it**, the more useful it is to everyone.

# BITCOIN, THE UNIT

One thing that muddies up the picture a bit is that none of the numbers written in the ledger actually have any real-world value tied to them. They are all denominated in a new unit called the ""satoshi,"" so named after the inventor of Bitcoin. No one is sure what a satoshi is worth, so we let the value of a satoshi be determined by the fair market.

# BITCOIN, THE SPECULATION

Market-wise, Bitcoin seems to move in 4-year cycles centered around an event called the ""Halvening."" This Halvening marks a sharp drop in the number of new Bitcoins minted each year. This is built into the protocol and happens on a consistent schedule.

It takes a while for the market to adapt to the decreased flow, so about one year after every Halvening, we [historically see](https://digitalik.net/btc/) giant spikes followed by **giant drops** as the market figures out the new price. We are in the middle of one of these spikes right now. This is the **riskiest time to speculate** because a **giant drop** may be coming. 

There is a reason I'm highlighting ""**giant drop**"" over and over. Beware.

It is important to understand these **giant drops** because it is easy to freak out and panic-sell if you aren't expecting it. When it comes, fear will be at an all-time high, and you will hear ""Bitcoin is dead!"" over and over. They will seem right, but they are wrong. No matter what reasons they attribute to *this* drop, it is a natural part of every cycle. They are afraid because they don't understand the cycle, so they invent their own reasons.

Dumping your fortune into a spike and then panic-selling during a **giant drop** is how you get burned. Hard.

Because of all the fear, a **giant drop** usually leads to an extended period of undervaluation for some time after. It takes two or three years to stabilize on the right value. This period is the **safest time to speculate**. Everyone will be afraid, having just been burned. Prices will be low. But you do not need to fear, because you understand the next cycle is coming.

# BITCOIN, THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE

The four-year cycle I described above is low-key brilliant. The giant spikes lead to massive hype in the media, which brings in a flood of new awareness and **increased** **demand**. Likewise, the giant drops that inevitably follow also get massive coverage. As they say, even bad publicity is good publicity—it's free advertising. On top of all that, the cycle repeats only once every four years, giving two or three years of rest between, so you don't see fatigue. All of this media attention leads to **increased demand**.

And the market is all about **supply and demand**.

In the past, the Halvenings have consistently caused the value of Bitcoin to ratchet up every four years. If you think about it, that makes sense.

Existing holders do not want to sell because Bitcoin has a track-record of amazing returns. They have no reason to sell their best-performing asset, which makes **existing supply hard to get**. In fact, they are greedy for **more of it**.

At the same time, Halvenings make **new supply hard to get**. The fact that **new supply is** **cut in half** every four years means that everyone is in a rush to snap up Bitcoin because it will be **exponentially harder to get in the future**.

The Halvenings are brilliant not just because they reduce supply and increase demand, but because they lead to a virtuous cycle of **increasingly** reduced supply and **increasingly** increased demand.

# BITCOIN, AND YOU

At the end of the day, **no one can tell the future**.

When it comes to your finances, all standard investment advice applies. Bitcoin is a new technology. That means it has untold potential, but that also means it has untold risk. Fortunes can be made, but they can be destroyed as well. Understand that you are **speculating on an unknown future**. Past performance does not guarantee future returns. Be careful not to put in more than you can afford to lose. If you are losing sleep over the price movements of Bitcoin, you have probably put in too much.

It is generally good advice to **keep your finances** **diversified**. As they say, do not put all of your eggs in a single basket. If disaster strikes, you could lose everything. It is better to have two or three strategies that you follow, rather than just one. That way, if one fails, you can fall back on the others. Full-market index funds and real estate are considered by many to be relatively safe options.

Finally, there are two virtues that tend to pay off in finances: **patience and an iron stomach**. Bitcoin's value seems to ratchet up every 4 years, so it makes sense that you will need to wait a similar amount of time to turn a profit. Having the patience to take a position early and hold for 10 or 20 years will put you lightyears ahead of someone looking for a quick profit, at far less risk. But doing that means you cannot just sell at the first sign of trouble.

I don't remember who said it, but this seems like wise advice: ""When deciding whether to sell, ask yourself if something fundamental has changed about your investment. If the fundamentals remain intact, you have no reason to sell.""

Good luck!",2021-02-10
