0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,392,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,152,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09

10,"Why Bitcoin is not a cult, but the fiat system is.",92,m96k8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m96k8y/why_bitcoin_is_not_a_cult_but_the_fiat_system_is/,51,2021-03-20 20:59:38,"As the media continues to talk about Bitcoin, I see a recurring narrative being put forward by  legacy financial experts; the lack of intrinsic value.

So let's take a look at the intrinsic value of fiat. (let's stick to dollars and euros for this) The cost to produce a $100 bill is the same as the production cost for a $1 bill. The paper itself is worthless. In fact most dollars and euros are digital.

The value of these currencies comes solely from the promise of the government that they are worth something. If history is a barometer on how trustworthy a government promise is, it is evident this promise instills very little trust.

But it is worse than that. Governments don't even feel the need to earn your trust. They just don't give you a choice to believe in anything else. They force it upon you. Fiat is the religion that you where born with. It is the reward system that allows you to live. By design, in the western world, you are indoctrinated by the belief that labour gets gewarded by fiat, that risk gets rewarded by fiat, that success gets rewarded by fiat. (There is a reason for government backed lotteries you know.) Even the punishment system mostly relies on the confiscation of fiat. (from traffic tickets, to high crimes)

Everybody has been made slave to the money.

If you were born and raised in a muslim society, you become a muslim. If you were born and raised in a christian society, you become a christian. Same goes for government issued fiat. You have no choice but to embrace it, or be rejected in your entirety. (Scientology anyone?)

Bitcoin is the exact opposite of this cult in fact.

It is not enforced upon anyone. You have the choice to believe in it or to dismiss it. It's value is derived from the faith of people in bitcoin. It's value is therefore derived on free will. If you reject it, you are free to do so.

It is an honest asset in the sense that is driven by supply and demand. Sure, there is manipulation going on (mostly from entities with ties to legacy finance by the way), but the effect of the manipulation can only shrink with growing adoption. The same cannot be said about fiat. In fact the more fiat circulates, the bigger the manipulation.

To add to that, unlike the fiat system, in which money production costs are the same regardless of the amount of money being printed, bitcoin relies on proof of work. As price goes up, production costs go up. (Spare me the envirornmental fud, which is nonsensical for a bunch of reasons not relevant to this post.)

Critics often refer to the fact that Bitcoin has only been around for 12 years. It could be a flash in the pan, a temporary fad.

Well, the dollar, as a fiat currency, has only been around for 50 years. The euro is only 20 years old. In fact the euro was only 9 years old when bitcoin was conceived. Not that much of a difference.

The chance of the euro disappearing seems greater to me than bitcoin disappearing.

Just some food for thought.",2021-03-20

39,Selling 1 Bitcoin now is as foolish as selling a Manhattan's block in the 17th Century,118,m8zfb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m8zfb1/selling_1_bitcoin_now_is_as_foolish_as_selling_a/,100,2021-03-20 12:25:12,"NEVER sell it for Government ever worth-less printed-to-infinity coupons/promises/IOU's. 

If you ever need fiat, because someone refuses to take real/sound money as payment, borrow it against your prime real estate.

Also if possible, don't buy from that 'someone' in the first place, give your business to smart and ethical people accepting Bitcoin.

> Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. **Manhattan is historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 for 60 guilders, which equals roughly $1059 in current terms.**[22][23][24] The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664[24] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[25] New York, based in present-day Manhattan, served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[26] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th century[27] and is a world symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and peace.[28] Manhattan became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898.

Hypothetically speaking if you had 10 Bitcoin where would you store it long-term, among the following options?  Assume for this hypothetical that these Bitcoin are almost purely profit from early Bitcoin investments and are not anticipated to be needed any time soon.  Priorities are safety and to a lesser  (but still significant) extent liquidity and APR/returns.  

- Blockfi/Nexo/Celsius

- Exchange ie Coinbase 

- Cold storage on a hardware wallet 

- Grayscale or similar off-chain asset",2021-03-21
