0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,162,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,69,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09

We already know that everyone has different spending habits and have different costs of living depending on where they live. 

What would that number of BTC could be for the average Joe in the US or Europe? What would that number be if someone was willing to move to South America or Southeast Asia?

Is that 1BTC? 3BTC? 5BTC?

In my opinion anyone with more than half a coin with 20+ years to retire should have more than the the current average of savings at retirement (Average Retirement Savings for Ages 65-69: $206,819.35, [https://www.synchronybank.com/blog/median-retirement-savings-by-age/](https://www.synchronybank.com/blog/median-retirement-savings-by-age/)).

That is why I think everyone should try to get their hands on half a coin that will try to never to sell and save for retirement. 

Now, inflation is arguably going to increase, devaluing savings, plus we know that the average is most often not good enough unfortunately, that is why I think the true goal should be to have one whole coin set aside for retirement. 

From there, anything is icing on the cake IMO. 

I also believe the space is early and if Bitcoin become what it intends, you will be able to use your BTC to borrow against it and not need to sell. 

As always, BTC is an investment with its risks, it could go to 0. Don't invest what you cannot afford to lose. However, I believe the risk is decreasing by the day and BTC is currently the most asymmetric opportunity out there.

I logged with his account to check it out and I saw the account activity. There was a transfer to some wallet 20 minutes ago. I checked out the login activity and it says someone logged in 21 minutes ago and logged out 19 minutes ago. 

He didn't have 2FA (I just enabled it for him) and his password was kindof short (9 digits with upper, lowercase, numbers and symbols).

He had $1k USD in btc (which doesn't seem like much, but for someone living in a 3rd world country, that was his entire savings). 

I opened a ticket to Paxful but I doubt there gonna do anything. Having the wallet address is pointless right? It's totally anonymous?

The logged account IP from where the transfer was made was from Pakistan.

Anyway, it's really sad :/",2021-03-12

48,Imagine if you educate one person a day on the value of Bitcoin,16,m2tno1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m2tno1/imagine_if_you_educate_one_person_a_day_on_the/,6,2021-03-12 00:06:26,"I had a quick, random chat with someone about Bitcoin. He was very skeptical about Bitcoin, saying it is only used for illegal transactions. I politely countered his point by saying the USD is also used for illegal transactions. I also tried to tell him that BTC has a lot of value to citizens of countries where their currency is being devalued or they don't have formalized banking system. 

Think about this: we control the power to spread the knowledge of BTC. If you educate one person on the value of BTC, that information proliferates at a compound rate, much like the growth of BTC! The more educated I am on BTC, the more I can help other people see that it solves a major problem in society today. I believe it is very similar to the early days of the internet, where everyone thought it was a hoax.",2021-03-12
