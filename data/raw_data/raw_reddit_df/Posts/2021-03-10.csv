0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,123,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,54,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption üëá

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ‚¨áÔ∏è

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue.

This is why we need to continue to educate people on the benefits of Bitcoin. Not even as an investment, but as security. Currency values will change, emergencies will happen where banking may not be the best option. BTC will stay secure and, as we continue to push, more widely accepted.

This time, Norwegian oil billionaire [Kjell Inge Rokke spoke out in favor of bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/norwegian-oil-billionaire-kjell-inge-rokke-btc-worth-millions-dollars-liquid-assets-bitcoin/). His Aker ASA, which controls oil and oilfield services companies, announced on Monday that it has set up a new business, Seetee AS, to harness the potential of cryptocurrency. In his address to shareholders, Rocque said:

‚Äú*We will use Bitcoin as our treasury asset and join the community. In Bitcoin, people like us are considered hodlers. "" He further added: ‚ÄúThe direction is clear: finance will be destroyed as inevitably as fossil fuels. The question is not if, but when. Bitcoin could be the core of a new monetary architecture. If so, then one bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars*.""

But the funniest thing is not even that billionaires started talking about the inevitability of a financial collapse, now they are joined by a person who can manually arrange a financial collapse. He had already proven this phenomenal ability by causing the collapse of the British pound in September 1992. Meet the new bitcoin enthusiast and hodler - **George (drum roll) SOROS.**

Fund Soros, New York Life and [Morgan Stanley](https://thebitcoinnews.com/morgan-stanley-analyst-true-price-of-bitcoin-could-be-zero/) invested $ 200 million [in the BTC investment company NYDIG](https://news.bitcoin.com/soros-fund-new-york-life-morgan-stanley-investors-200-million-bitcoin-investment-firm/) (New York digital investment group).

NYDIG is part of Stone Ridge Asset Management, which recently filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for one of its open-ended mutual funds for investing in bitcoin. The founder of Stone Ridge, who also founded NYDIG, Ross Stevens, said Soon, you'll just see a wall of money entering Bitcoin.

**Summarize**:

**The financial system will collapse.**  
**Bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars.**  
**We will soon see the wall of money entering Bitcoin.**

There are three major concerns I have with Bitcoin, if it appreciates significantly. I have tried looking through this forum and through many other articles online, but have never found my concerns addressed, so I thought I want to try this community:

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin Could Promote Greater Wealth Extremes**

Many people argue that Bitcoin is fairer than the current financial system by using the following two arguments:

1. A financial system based on Bitcoin would be much more equitable to everyone since it irons out some of the glaring issues with the current financial system (e.g., lending; real inflation not being captured)
2. Anyone can buy Bitcoin right now and share in the wealth that will be generated as price appreciates

The first statement (that I strongly believe is true) deals with the future, and not the path there. The path there is what I am concerned about since it could lead to significant destruction. 

[https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/#:\~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Bloomberg,wealth%20in%20the%20Bitcoin%20network](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Bloomberg,wealth%20in%20the%20Bitcoin%20network).

The glassnode link states ""2% of network entities control 71.5% of all Bitcoin."" Though the 71.5% is admittedly on the high side, it is alarming that there much wealth could be concentrated by such few participants. On the other end, some estimate that the top 1% own 40-50% of all wealth currently:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution\_of\_wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth)

It is impossible to tell whether the distribution is much more equitable (that I know of) than what we currently have, but it seems doubtful that low income earners, people on pensions, retirees, etc. are going to be investing at the same proportions as high net worth individuals (who could invest 10% of their entire portfolio in Bitcoin without the same risk to their living). People in Silicon Valley or global tech centers that were first aware of Bitcoin would disproportionately benefit from the rise, whereas those most disconnected from the centers of innovation would be left behind, which is not different/better than the current system. 

As Bitcoin rises, the current distribution will be more and more difficult to smooth out. As large investors start entering, it will become harder and harder for smaller players to have a significant share of the pie. People that do not invest in Bitcoin could be completely out of luck if Bitcoin goes to $10-40 trillion as some project. People that own Bitcoin could outbid those without on real estate, food, water, etc. That scenario is not much different than the current one, where ""using"" the financial system (e.g., trading in the stock market) can yield more wealth than doing productive work (e.g., working in the service industry, building factories, developing technologies). Governments would not be able to offer any kind of social safety net for those left behind because fiat currency would be effectively worthless in this scenario. A complete lack of confidence in any government body, and possibly even riots and looting would ensue by the disgruntled ""left behind.""

One could argue that the risk Bitcoin investors took by investing early warrants the wealth they accumulate. But my concern is that the same argument could be used for kings/dictators, and aligning with royalty early and suppressing others who were slow to pick-up later. That is not a sustainable system, because it would lead to failed states and rioting (e.g., Venezuela). 

Yes, most people could buy bitcoin right now. Yes, the access to bitcoin is somewhat equitable to a person‚Äôs current spot on the wealth distribution curve. However, information access is not necessarily equitable, and devaluation of fiat currency-based wage payments disproportionately disenfranchises the poor: shifts to Bitcoin expedite the devaluation.

Bitcoin could also cause easier tax avoidance, especially for the wealthy, expanding wealth gaps further.

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin Could Collapse the World Financial Market**

I think some people desire this outcome, but let me address my concern: 

You would struggle to find a single company with a market cap. above a penny stock that has outperformed Bitcoin this year. People could see that Bitcoin has risen 600-700% this year and decide that it is a better investment than equities, so they remove their wealth from equities and put it into Bitcoin, driving the price up, creating a positive feedback loop where equities drop, bitcoin falls, and the system encourages further redistribution. This would lead to a scenario where everyone wants Bitcoin but no one wants to invest in companies because of the rate of return difference. Companies would suffer without the support of investors, and productivity would greatly diminish, possibly leading to a global depression. This could happen with other assets such as commodities or real estate, but the liquidity of bitcoin and devout following is causing larger appreciation. So, we do not have a good historical comparison, to my knowledge.

I have heard the argument that Bitcoin's price would eventually flatten out as more participants enter and would stop rising after a point (although this is hypothetical), but if this took a year to happen, the damage could already be done. 

&#x200B;

**Governments Could Step in or Become Useless**

If the two situations above look like they are on the verge of being realized, governments would be compelled to act, which brings me to my last point: governments could attempt to regulate or devalue Bitcoin. One scenario would be all the buy-in into Bitcoin causes governments to globally agree to disregard their fiat currencies and exchange all assets in their currencies, on an equal basis, into one decentralized token-based currency (not Bitcoin; a new one optimized to handle the large amount of transactions that would be involved). Therefore, everyone is starting from the same place, but all the improvements of removing fiat currencies will be realized. The counter argument is that countries like the US would never give up control over their currency since it gives them so much power, but I am not saying this scenario is at all likely, unless things changed dramatically, and they were desperate.

I will not even get into the fact that without means of controlling the financial system, it is certainly harder for governments to enforce global guidelines (e.g., with regards to nuclear weapons, terrorism, etc.). There is also nothing that can be done in economic crises to prevent a market collapse, but perhaps natural order implies that things should run their course. 

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**  

I want to be clear I am not attacking Bitcoin, and hope that someone has a good rebuttal (links or opinions) to any of these concerns. Thanks for reading!",2021-03-11

Once there, you've connected yoruself to the lightning network! congrats! And now you have sats that can be used for very small fees, no matter how high the fees are on the base layer. Don't think about it as 'locking up' your coins in 'channels', rather think of it as *liberating* your coins from the burden of onchain fees and slow confirmations: you can now pay stuff *instantly* with almost *no fees*.

And you can keep your wallet and sats within *for years*: no need to be online all the time as some people say, no need to worry about incoming liquidity, all these wallets have various ways to take care of that under the hood or as options given in  the menus.

And then play with it. Buy a gift card, buy bitcoin on an exchange that accept lightning payments, tips developpers, play games, pay your bills, buy food, lots of possibility, and much more to come in the coming years.

36,Bitcoin‚Äôs Carbon Footprint - a fair comparison,42,m1y2va,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m1y2va/bitcoins_carbon_footprint_a_fair_comparison/,16,2021-03-10 22:01:12,"Bitcoin is recognised as a store of value making it comparable to gold. In 2020, 3,200 tonnes of gold was mined equating to approximately  90,301,440 million tonnes of CO2 emitted. 

In comparison Bitcoin is estimated to emit around 37 million tonnes of CO2 over the course of 2021, with China powering 65% of the hash rate in March 2021. China pledges to be net zero by 2050 along with most of the world under the Paris agreement. Under the assumption this is achieved this would indicate Bitcoin would be powered by renewable energy by 2050 making it a zero carbon technology. 
In addition, gold mining is renowned to be one of the most destructive industries responsible for polluting drinking water with cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals, whilst destroying pristine environments and causing damaging health effects. Removing reliance on the need for gold not only has the potential to decarbonise the gold reserve industry but also reduces these negative environmental and health impacts. However, the reliance on countries sticking to the Paris Agreement is needed in order to decarbonise Bitcoin. 

Edit: Information on China‚Äôs energy policy 

China uses the most cost effective renewables and could viably generate 60% of its energy with green energy by 2030.  It is estimated the renewable energy implementation could save China around 11% in monetary cost. Feasibly following the laws of economics Bitcoin miners will be more likely to use renewable energy sources if they are cheaper. Therefore, reducing Bitcoin‚Äôs carbon footprint.

I buy bitcoin with cashapp which is owned by square. So I'm helping them aquire bitcoin. If bitcoin takes off to mars then square probably will too.

As of for tesla... Them being an early corporate adopter means that If it skyrockets passed 100k then my tesla shares will go up with it. 

While this may be a simplistic view supporting the companies that support my currency of choice will help progress bitcoin to a globally accepted currency.

This is due to the fact that, apparently, they already know.

I've onboarded multiple people over the last few weeks, and all it took was mentioning my Bitcoin knowledge in their presence. They already knew it was a good idea to buy, they just didn't really know how, and were a little too lazy to try to figure it out for themselves.

People like Bitcoin now. Even if it's sometimes just for the gains, it's pretty easy to get the ""literally just hodl"" strat across.

So remember: Help people buy Bitcoin! You know the exchanges, you know the wallets, you might even know lightning. It's surprisingly easy to get people to buy! Give them a good exchange and a good wallet to use, and tell them to just hodl, and back up their wallets!
