1,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,315,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,120,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

There’s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

“ Today, the Brew unveiled a brand new design for our Markets section with some pretty big changes. So before we get into the day's business news, we wanted to provide a little insight into why we made the switch.

From a graphics POV, we got rid of some unnecessary white space so that, with just a quick glance, you can tell if indicators moved up or down.

You also probably noticed that we removed oil and gold. In their place, we added 1) bitcoin and 2) a ""flex"" spot, which will allow us to showcase any security—whether it's a tech stock, oil, or dogecoin—that made an interesting move the previous day. Today we picked JPMorgan stock because of the turmoil around the banking sector.”

Ok ladies & gents,

To some, this recent pull back might look like a repeat of the correction after Elon's candle but it's not.

Here's why:

1. Adoption is increasing (Visa, MasterCard, Tesla, Square, PayPal, JPM, GS, BNY, BlackRock). All of these companies don't mess around and are all taking action towards adopting crypto.
2. Inflation - Do I really need to explain this? Go look at the M2 money supply or the price of any commodity over the last year and you'll get the picture
3. Interest rates might be increasing but they can't go that high. Look up Operation Twist for more info, this is a can of worms I don't want to open right now but basically short-term rates are going up for the near future and long-term rates will go down incentivizing long-term investment in the economy. This will balance out over time and people worrying about rates jumping shouldn't because it would literally break the entire world economy if you don't believe me refer to #2
4. The price is being manipulated right now for either institutions (most likely) or whales to accumulate at a lower price

Proof:

This is called a sell wall. To newbies, this may look like someone trying to offload a bunch of BTC so they can get out but this is an extremely common tactic seen in both the traditional financial markets as well as cryptocurrency markets. It works particularly well in crypto because volume is so low. The idea is (relatively) simple. Pretend you want to buy a bunch of BTC without pushing the price up too much. You can't buy it all at once so you need to spread it out over time. But hang on, doing that will cause a bunch of green candles in a row and everybody and their mom will jump in on the action so what do you do?

You pretend you're selling a bunch for more than what you want to buy it for. This will scare people into selling at or below your sell wall, allowing you to buy up all their BTC for the price you want. Once you have what you want, you take away the sell wall (prepare for launch) and buy up until people join in (to the moon) . This is what happening literally right now so if you're selling stop. My guess is there will be an announcement soon about another company investing in BTC or an investment bank/hedge fund just got they're trading desk running.

TL;DR - Always buy the dip.",2021-03-30

There's three main reasons I've determined people hfsp. For those that don't know, this means have fun staying poor. This is not ONLY money...this is also a state of mind.

1. Risk avoidance. You can have hfsp in $, but you can also hfsp in friends, dating, health, and overall happiness. I have 2 friends who literally refuse to make any real attempts at dating, and then wonder why they don't have relationships. I don't hate to break it to you-life has risks. Any surefire or easy bet is a fast path to the poor house. You know who I think buys bitcoin when it's ""safe"". The people at $500,000. In this climate of massive prin$ing, I believe saving tons of cash is a sure fire way to poverty. Avoiding all risk is the biggest risk of all.
2. No real plans. Do you have a plan? I sure as hell don't for much of my life. I better write it down. You know why gamblers lose? Because their real plan is to leave the casino with no money left. Write your goals down. I'm over the bitcoin maximalist stuff coming from people who try to shame those who sell. Some people in crypto have $10,000,000 and no family-they can take the massive swings. Other's can't. Whether your goal is to get to $10,000 or $100,000,000-write your goals down, and how you expect to get there. Most of my friends who have not bought homes have not done so because of lack of $-in fact, they have the highest paying jobs, the most saved, etc...they have no plan.
3. Don't be a victim-educate yourself. Do you think you are smart? I'm sure as hell not. Most of us are average, and many below average, thinkers. You want to make $? Go after the people that have real $$. Understand what it took. Ask questions. Don't be fake. Ask real questions. Go on twitter. Look up videos on youtube. Look at the pros and cons. Don't try to be a smart ass....try to educate yourself.
