Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption üëá

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ‚¨áÔ∏è

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09

Full disclosure, I hold small amounts of Bitcoin in a hardware wallet and I also have IRA funds invested in GBTC as well as some on Coinbase.

Recently I've been talking to family members about investing in Bitcoin and I realize they have no business ever holding their own keys. I believe they are far better off using something like Paypal, Coinbase, Robinhood or investing through GBTC/OBTC etc. These people are smart and educated but older and not that tech savvy.

Almost daily I see a post here from someone that has managed to lose their coins in any number of ways. Yet, also daily I see comments advising not to use Paypal/CashApp/RobinHood or Coinbase to hold Bitcoin. Having a 3rd party do the custodial duties is actually a valuable service to the majority of people. I know it's popular here to use hardware wallets and protect the seed words, but how will people handle that when they start to get dementia? I'm wondering what I will do in a decade or 3 when I may not be as sharp as I am today. I believe insured custodial services are the future for the vast majority of future Bitcoin users and we shouldn't discourage their use.",2021-03-12

It's been over 8 years since the creation of the iconic [magic internet money bitcoin wizard](https://www.bitcoinwizard.com?lolmoney), and thanks to all of you guys, bitcoin is booming! Finally got around making a website (linked above) with some merch that accepts crypto as payment as well as monopoly money. I've also [minted the wizard as a NFT at foundation.app](https://foundation.app/mavensbot/magic-internet-money-bitcoin-wizard-5252).

I want to thank everyone for supporting, helping and teaching each other. Never have I thought bitcoin would be where it is today so quickly. I've seen so many generous charity donations over the years. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way.

I miss the good old days. bitcoin was a big part of my life for a decade. Not just about the money but I miss running 10 nodes to help bitcoin, paper wallets, all the websites, mining, vanitygen, so many memories flood back. I remember my avalon and KNC miners, Bitinstant, mtgox and I still have the friends I've made along the way.

Each advancement makes Bitcoin more grounded and better at taking care of the issues of the current monetary and money related framework. It's made another age of crypto early adopters, utilizing cryptography to change the world; and now having capital to build our future.

In case you're at any point favored with crypto fortune, consider supporting these projects.

Those who use it show a clear lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works, but maybe most importantly, they fail to propose a superior alternative that fixes that problem.

I am writing these 2 arguments for me and anyone else that would want to push back on this stupid inefficiency argument.

&#x200B;

1. Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger with strictly enforced rules built upon battled-tested cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA and SHA256.   
Participating in this decentralized ledger requires finding a piece of information, nonce, so that the SHA256 of such information is below a certain threshold.  This is the job of the miners.  
It is up to the participants to decide how to find that piece of information. You can use a pen and paper, a pocket calculator, a fortune teller, or an ASIC powered by your own Uranium-235 plant.   
The Bitcoin network doesn't say anything on how to find these nonces; that is up to the miners. These miners found that ASICs powered by industrial electricity seem to work nicely. They purchase these ASICs, pay for the electricity they use, and run an open-source code in them. How can the government have a say in the kind of software and the scale at which I run it in my own private property as long as I am paying the bill?
2. If you are going to criticize Bitcoin, you have to propose an alternative, and ideally, a better alternative.  
Mrs. Janet Yellet called Bitcoin an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting monetary transactions"" just a few days ago. The immediate question that comes to mind is, what should I use instead then?  
I guess her answer would be the USD, coincidentally and of course exempt of any conflict of interest; that's the shitcoin she helps to govern.   
The problem is that I, nor millions of others, want to use the USD. Time and again, governments of the world have lied and manipulated their currencies.   
The US being no exception. In 1933 the US government forbade the ""hoarding"" of gold - Order 6102 mandated US citizens to sell their gold to the Fed at a price the Fed itself set or face a 10-year prison term. More recently, in 1971, our great government temporarily suspended the convertibility of gold. Temporarily, in this context, means that 50 years later, we still cannot convert our dollars to gold.  
She fails to recognize that Bitcoin is a far superior alternative to the USD because of the systematic institutional betrayal. Said shitcoin can be printed at will, and ad-infinitum, rendering your hard-earned savings useless. For these reasons, people are moving to Bitcoin, choosing to trust cryptographic algorithms, not the government.

&#x200B;

So until I hear a better alternative, I am HODLing for dear life.",2021-03-12

Family, friends, colleagues.....like a few of them have changed....cause I have been harping about Bitcoin for several years while Bitcoin hovered around $7k......and most of the people around me were like ""yea yea whatever"".....

When BTC started climbing in 2020 December I bought some ""more expensive than usual"" Xmas presents, like a Rolex for myself and macbooks for my family, a few good level above what people around me buy for others.....and then BTC climbs to $57k now..... there is a substancial change in people treat me.

Many Girls in the office would try ask me out for drinks after work even on a week day and some of them would tease and try suss out how many BTC I hold. My parents and siblings would be like ""oh my dearest son how is your Bitcoin doing?"". My colleagues at work are like ""hey man you want to go fishing with us this weekend?"" All these never happened before I was nobody before all this.

Like overall it is a good feeling as people around me respect me more and more as BTC price climbs. But I also worry how they may start targeting me for my Bitcoin.....I wish I havent told some of them that I accumulated 7 Bitcoin before, because they kind of now know how much I own.

Does anyone here have similar experience?",2021-03-12

in reality, all shitcoins end up losing out in comparison to bitcoin. if you need proof, just look at a chart of eth denominated in btc. it's pathetic. the other thing is that no other network is as credibly decentralized as btc. every other coin has a single person who can exert near total control of the network. it's fake decentralization. fake censorship resistance.

the real issue though is that shitcoins are just a zero sum pump and dump game. that's a game for losers. you're not a loser. don't play that game.

bitcoin however is a game of enabling our entire global civilization to break through to a more productive and egalitarian level, where value accrues to those who create the most value for other humans, rather than just accruing to those who are close to the money printer since 1914, 1934 and 1971. it's a game where the rules are the same for all players, rather than a game where only a small set of players has artificially favorable rules, and everyone else gets f!@#'d to varying degrees.

They have the right mentality. The CFTC and SEC are the suits. 

These agencies are hurting development of crypto in the united states and pissing on the wheels of progress. They are bullys, they bully foreign exchanges mercilessly without offering us citizen any domestic alternative, so that coinbase can aboslutely rob us all with monopolistic fees.

I just don't get why people do not actually call congress, and actually write to these agencies and make a fuss.

Channel your inner Karen. If these congressman and agencies had 100,000 gen z/y wallstreet bet bitcoin fiends blowing their phone and fax off demanding domestic products and services, we'd get somewhere. 

SEC and CFTC are bullies that work for suits, you need to bully back.",2021-03-13
