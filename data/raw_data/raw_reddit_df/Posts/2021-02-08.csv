32,Some guy at the weed shop told me to buy into bitcoin 8 months ago,411,lf6s0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lf6s0b/some_guy_at_the_weed_shop_told_me_to_buy_into/,64,2021-02-08 15:34:57,"This was way back in July when BTC was around 8k a coin. I met this dude at my local medical marijuana dispensary and we got to talking about money and investing. He wouldn't shut the fuck up about Bitcoin and how we all need to invest our money into it while it's low. The last thing he said before he left was ""I promise you won't regret it"". He spoke with alot of clarity and certainty, so that interaction stuck with me. The next few days I did my due diligence on researching Bitcoin and decided to toss around $1600 into it just to test the waters. I also called my dad, and somehow by the grace of of God, convinced him to invest into BTC. He bought 5k worth.

Fast forward to today and my dad and I both have more than doubled our investments. We've both since been investing more money into BTC and we follow it pretty closely. My dad is very happy with his BTC investment and I feel like a proud son for introducing him to it. And don't worry....we HODL. We see it being a retirement fund situation.

To that guy at the weed shop who told me to invest into BTC, thank you. Your advice not only has helped double my networth, but you helped strengthen my relationship with my father.

**Edit: It just occurred to me that the guy who was raving all about Bitcoin and told me to invest in it probably has made a ton of money from BTC since. He really believes in Bitcoin and spoke of it with conviction. He opened my eyes to a whole new world of currency. I'm sure he's sitting on an extremely generous profit. I'm happy for that guy.*",2021-02-08

In a filling with the **US Securities and Exchange Comission**, the company said that, in January 2021, it ""updated investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity.""

According to Tesla, they may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.

""We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them,"" the company said.

As for the accounting, the car manufacturer said that the cost basis of the digital assets will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increases in their quoted prices on the active exchanges. ""Gains (if any) will not be recorded until realized upon sale,"" they added.

I live in an apartment that I rent on Airbnb anytime I want to travel and do a bit of digital nomading. With the money I make from the apartment and the Swiss salary, I can travel and work from anywhere. On top of that, as a Blockchain engineer, I'm heavily invested in Bitcoin and I made more money with my investments last year than my yearly salary. I'm 27.

I just wanted to share that everything I chose to be and what I believe to be true and just in this world came to me the moment I understood Bitcoin in 2016. Since I followed the Bitcoin path and made it my specialization, I'm being vindicated for every sat I stack.

- I believe in a society where the only purpose of government is to follow the will of its people.
- I believe in free markets that cannot be manipulated.
- I believe in democracy where elections can't be manipulated and the will of the majority is the one to follow (or fork from).
- I believe in a unique currency for all.
- I believe in decentralisation, censorship resistance and permissionless networks for all.
- I believe in remote working where no country's borders or desk in an office can enslave you.
- I believe in sound money.
- I believe in game theory and autonomous organisations. 
- I believe in an open standard, a protocol with the purpose of transmitting value (which is a form on information). The missing piece of the internet.
