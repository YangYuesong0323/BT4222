Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,476,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,162,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

There’s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

When discussing the regulations about defi you may believe it only applies to altcoins. This is deeply wrong and misguided. First of all there are platforms being developed that use unwrapped native bitcoin. Second of all, any of these laws against DeFi in general will absolutely destroy the future of bitcoin as an independent government free tool. It will be fully controlled by KYC, globally, in every single area except private wallet to wallet transactions. anything that so much as looks like Local Bitcoins will be KYC'd with extreme prejudice. You will have no real fundamental freedom from the government. Microsoft is even developing bitcoin layer 2 smart contracts that have built in KYC. 

Chainalysis will be used against you with extreme prejudice, very little bitcoin will truly be fungible, and it will be dangerous to acquire. 

What the bitcoin community tries to convey as a antithesis to altcoins, to me really comes across as an antithesis to layer 2 solutions. 

Bitcoiners do not want to deal with the regulations that will fundamentally dictate layer 2 and lightning network, yet if the western governments get their way, none of these layer 2 functionalities will ever exist without KYC and mass surveillance, ergo you will never see the separation of money and state. 

This is why the definition of non entities, non companies, non custodians as vasp is a mortal threat to liberty and the values of bitcoin. It's why the travel rule is so bad. It prevents any real freedom from this state intrusion. 

You as a community need to realize what layer 2 is, what web 3.0 is, and defend it, because it is the most important cultural battle of our lives.",2021-04-01

I told him I have little to lose and much to win, and that maybe and just maybe one day it is worth enough for me to build a house, which is my dream.

I don't think getting maybe 150000€ ($175000) is impossible. It is indeed a very hard to reach target, but... He really makes me feel down about all this.

 ***A longtime Bitcoin bull and the founder of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz*** [***spoke about Bitcoin's future.***](https://news.bitcoin.com/boomers-adopt-cryptocurrency-trillion-dollars-bitcoin-novogratz/)

He explained that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, rich baby boomers will be the next generation to come to the bitcoin market.

>*“It could be as much as a trillion dollars comes over the next year from that giant group of wealth."" - declared Novogratz.*

Baby Boomers are those who were born around the end of World War II until the mid-1960s. They were the main beneficiaries of the massive stimulus packages that pumped asset values ​​in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Many of them see bitcoin as an asset that can significantly increase its value, as well as protect their savings from inflation caused by the massive printing of money.

>*""If you’re worried that the U.S. is printing too many dollars … you’re going to shift some of your savings into bitcoin.""*  
*- Michael Novgorats.*

If the CEOs of JMP Securities and Galaxy Digital are not wrong, then in the coming months, huge amounts of money will begin to flow into the bitcoin market, and by the end of the year, their inflow will amount to $2.5 trillion. Now the capitalization of the first cryptocurrency is $1.2 trillion. If you add these two sums, then the capitalization of BTC by the end will reach $3.7 trillion, hence the price of bitcoin will be $177,754.

But since in free circulation, according to Glassnode, at the beginning of the year there were only 4.2 million bitcoins, a reasonable question arises: *what exactly are the listed groups of investors going to buy?* Everything that is available to them on the market today, taking into account all the bitcoins available on exchange wallets and in OTC, is a maximum of 4.2 million BTC.

If we subtract from the total emission of bitcoin, which is 18.6 million today, belonging to the class of illiquid 14.5 million, then the estimated price of bitcoin will be **$711,000 by the end of the year**. And this is without taking into account the money of other buyers, who, of course, are present in the market and their number is growing all the time. It is worth adding an element of common panic buying that can arise against the backdrop of the rapid rise in the price of BTC.

Last year alone, Grayscale Capital and other funds bought about 1 million bitcoins on the market. Under the above-mentioned scenario, no more than 1 million BTC will remain in free circulation by the end of the year.

**Turns out, “To The Moon” is much closer than expected.**

She isn't very tech savvy a little bit like myself it took me a while to get used to self custody ect. So she asked me should she buy or should she give me the money what she wants to put in every month to me and I just buy at same time as I usually do and just withdraw to cold storage and keep all in one place?

Sorry if this is a stupid question but I said I actually wasn't sure. I thought maybe it would be best for her to buy herself and keep on an exchange.

For the past 3 months, I  have been reading through cryptocurrency articles and  getting familiarized with crypto communities but honestly I don’t seem to get the information i need on cryptocurrency investment.   
Do you have any tips/advice that would help me learn about this great investment?   
I would really love to be part of this community and head to the moon together!  
Thank you.",2021-03-31

It's too geeky and risky to them.

I decided to gift people a couple satoshis and guess what - they absolutely adore it!

Just 1000 sats can make persons day. I don't think I have ever seen anyone so happy to receive such a small gift.  But maybe the gift is the introduction to cryptocurrencies without the risk.

Spread the word, lightning is incredible and it will be adopted mainstream at some point or another. Gift your friends some sats!!!",2021-03-31

A coworker had first introduced this idea of bitcoin to me in our hallway chat and I ultimately have him to thank for being the type of person that could explain this to me really in-depth. Mind you, we are engineers so this type of nerd-tech is very appealing to us, at least more than the average joe. After he explained to me the significance of bitcoin and its potential use case, I was enthralled by its beautiful simplicity and used of computational mathematics to allow people to share money peer to peer. I remember watching YouTube videos and trying my best to understand how transactions were verified and what exactly the value was of this digital code in cyberspace. I'll be honest, it still is quite challenging to fully understand, but I think superficially I can understand its basic operation. Anyway, that conversation sparked an interest in me and I subsequently learned about exchanges and this new idea of a digital wallet. I promptly opened an account on an exchange and bought my first BTC, ETH, and some LTC. I remember watching my wallet like a hawk and even took some profits after what was probably a quick pump. Woohoo, I made $2k on that first position. I thought I was a fucking baller and for reference, BTC was probably around $1k at that time. I then do what all crytpo noobs did an invested those gains into other shitcoins and ICOs. Oh, the ICO craze of 2017. A lot of people learned lessons that year. I think I ended up only slightly in green after that entire fiasco. I had not held BTC all the way to $20k either. I just couldn't allow myself to buy something that parabolic. Then, I watched the market quickly crash and go into its bear cycle. I saw how low the demand was, FUD was at an all-time high, and not one peep about bitcoin in the mainstream media. For the newbies, when you don't hear about bitcoin -- FYI you're in the bear market. I ultimately forgot about BTC and thought all of the HODLers who's posts I read on reddit were fucking crazy. I decided to stay away for the time being because I didn't understand.

Now let's talk about how to lose big with opportunity costs.

Fast forward to the pandemic-induced crash of 2020. I knew the stock market had a nice juicy dip. I had been saving a bunch of money from salary pay and was just patiently waiting for some type of crash to occur, so I promptly opened up a robinhood account with $5k and acquired a variety of discounted stocks. However, I also noticed that bitcoin was hovering a price of $4500 or so. I thought wow, we've come a long way from that $20k rally in 2017. I used the leftover money in the RH account, about $200, and put in in. I thought eh, why not. BTC has been so sideways and now at $4k I figured it wouldn't hurt. I still wasn't a believer. 

Fast forward to end of Feb 2021. BTC rallies to $60k. Even for the past few weeks, it has yet to even dip below $50k. I now have been stacking sats more than ever before in my life. I watch a bunch of YouTube videos, hangout in the clubhouse rooms, listen to podcasts...the whole nine. I kick myself for waiting SO FREAKING LONG to just HODL and believe in this technology. With the money I had in a savings (pftt a fiat savings account, what a fucking joke), had I invested most of that into that delectable price of ~$4k, I would have been a millionaire this year. A fucking millionaire. However, as the great Michael Saylor said, ""You buy bitcoin at the price you deserve it."" Truer words cannot be spoken. I deserved to buy at $47k. You know what though? I am more convinced in the revolutionary power of bitcoin at $47k than I ever was at $4k. I think that is the most important thing about becoming a bitcoin convert. When you don't believe, you stare at a price of 4 thousand dollars per bitcoin and think, ""meh."" Most of you who have just started your crypto journey are probably on the fence too. I have a theory that it takes people a whole bull/bear cycle to finally take this seriously. It took me getting into this space in 2017 to understand what it’s like to lose faith, and then to have it restored in the bull run. Yes BTC can go to $20k, $40k,…$100k and beyond? YES. Even when this run comes crashing down, I'm HODLing my precious coins. So, I just wanted to share this story for those of you who might not understand yet. The maxis, the hodlers, the methodical sat stackers ... were all part of the ecosystem built on the hardest currency that has ever existed in our lifetime. 

**TL; DR**

*It took me a whole bitcoin cycle to come to terms with how powerful and meaningful bitcoin is for our generation. I was not convinced in 2017, but now I'm bullish as fuck and HODLing for life. *

I have some quick tips to share, just keep in mind I am in no way a financial advisor or financial expert. I'm just a guy who wants to make life changing monetary decisions for his family.

1)	Take BTC seriously now, don't wait. Chances are you have residual income sitting in a savings account. Unless you have an immediate need for it, invest it in bitcoin. Keep enough fiat to have a safety net in life incase you lose your job or whatever, but always stack sats. 

2)	Try you best to learn from as many different sources as you can. Get different opinions. Talk to people. Read. Find what you believe in and make sure you can explain it to someone clearly. For me, BTC is king.

3)	Set up a reoccurring payment on cash app. This will help you dollar-cost-average your way into bitcoin. They also have an awesome boost on their debit card that rewards you in BTC. 

4)	Hold your own keys. Stop leaving BTC in an exchange. You never know when you’re most vulnerable. Stay safe and don't get rekt.

5)	Tell everyone you know about bitcoin to the point it makes you annoying. Wealthy people who own mass amounts of fiat would like to keep you poor, to hide their secrets to wealth. Bitcoiners want everyone to participate and share knowledge. As the network increases (nodes and hodlers), so does the power of bitcoin. We’re in this together. 

6)	Never underestimate how messy it can be to sell during the blow off top. You might think you’re going to cash out in the high six figure range. I’m here to warn you that everyone else thinks that too. How are you going to sell when Coinbase crashes due to too many users selling at the same time? Either figure out how to efficiently take profits, or adjust your expectations. After all, we all rely on pretty much a handful of exchanges. Expecting them to perform under the most burdensome load is not realistic. 

7)	Be happy. You are staring at the opportunity of a generation. You are not late. If you’re here right now, you’re still early. No matter what, if you just HODL you will come out on top.",2021-04-01
