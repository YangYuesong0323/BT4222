Don't be fooled by the media; while I agree that some coins are more innovative in how they mine, bitcoin is still the one that's going mainstream and that's what scares the hell out of them.

Why are they so scared? Bitcoin is step one in curbing wealth inequality since it will be a lot more difficult for any institution to manipulate. They won't be able to just turn on the money printer to pump their stocks, meaning that we will no longer see the stock market grow while the consumer price index stays relatively stable (basically what I'm saying is that they put more money in the stock market while the money supply of everyday people stays the same, increasing wealth inequality). 

Back to my main point; bitcoin mining isn't being run off of oil and coal like all of these other companies news agencies don't seem to have a problem with. They're scared for different reasons.

Edit: I just realized that I misspelled hypocritical in the title, but can't change it. I'm well aware of it though.",2021-03-05
6,Bitcoin Selling Pressure,499,lximtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lximtr/bitcoin_selling_pressure/,170,2021-03-04 19:42:08,"Most of the selling pressure since mid-Jan has come from F2Pool (largest Chinese mining pool) affiliated wallets and it is now becoming clear why.  The Inner Mongolia region of China is banning bitcoin mining.  This region is responsible for 9% of the world's BTC mining.  It's a coal powered region however, which is the problem.  Beijing has come down on them for not meeting carbon neutrality targets.   They have until end of April to shut down, but it would appear they first got notice of this back in mid-January based on the BTC selling history.   Most will likely either move to the surplus hydro power regions of China or they will sell their rigs and shut down.  Apparently some will even be moving overseas. Many of these miners secured loans using their mining rigs as collateral, either to pay their bills so they didn't have to sell coin while the price was rising, or to buy more rigs  or bitcoin...but either way many are forced to sell some or all of their bitcoin to pay back loans or pay for their move.

[https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry](https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry)

The big question is, when will this selling stop?  End of April seems like the logical answer but I suspect it will taper off well before then.  Anyone moving, would have started the process by now I suspect.

There does also 'appear' to be F2Pool affiliated manipulation selling at times as well, like when there is heavy selling prior to the month end futures expiry they are involved.  However, there does seem to be a lot of coordinated FUD around this same time period which has me thinking other players are involved in this end of month manipulation and it's possible that some or all of the F2 selling at end of month could just be panic selling, like if they were waiting for a higher price to sell, but pulled the trigger when they saw the price starting to plunge down.  Hard to say for sure.  When it comes to futures expiries and for example call options, there is usually a particular strike price that jumps out at you in term of open interest.  For example, for tomorrow's weekly expiry, $50K is the price that jumps out at you.  I told a friend a few days ago don't be surprised if the price is 49K on Friday.  If that theory holds, the following week, the magic price is $66K, so let's see if we see a very strong next week.

One thing I've noticed of late is that the only time BTC price goes down is when there is selling pressure from F2Pool and whenever they are not selling the price surges higher.  So the big takeaway is that when they stop selling, we should see a moon shot.

9,Why did Bitcoin fall from it's peak at 58k? And how to relax...,68,lxr5nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lxr5nr/why_did_bitcoin_fall_from_its_peak_at_58k_and_how/,40,2021-03-05 02:11:12,"I have read posts here from people who feel that they made a mistake buying Bitcoin as it neared it's top at 58k.  I do not have a crystal ball, but I can tell you that after Tesla made it's announcement, there was a very large influx of long positions, based on margin trading.  You can see that in data,\\; this is not me gazing at my navel.  In fact, the influx was strong and continuous, and Bitcoin reflected it. Then, an unbelievable 2.5 billion BTC liquidation occurred on the night of the 22nd, I believe.  That is an incredible dump.  It is hard to get your head around it.  Why would that happen?

It didn't.  It was a fuckup.  Willy Woo, probably my favorite Bitcoin analyst, says he talked to the CTO at Glassnode, and basically it was a wallet labelling error.

But, the consequences, as you can imagine, were huge.  Overnight, we saw BILLIONS in those long positions on margin liquidate.  It was like the typical cascade effect as everyone on margin starts racing for the exit, and every time they liquidate a position, it builds on the race.

Additionally, all Bitcoin miners in Mongolia are shutting down.  They have been given the boot, and will shut down operations by April.  The Chinese authorities in their district have been told to reduce electrical usage.  Consequently, there is a steady drip drip drip of Bitcoins, partially because they floated a lot of infrastructure on the back of Bitcoins.  This will not last.

But... here is the thing.  This is a blip in the road, a speedbump you didn't see, and is meaningless in the inevitable progression of Bitcoin to over $100k.  If you bought in on the race to the top (I bought some on the way up), as long as you don't sell, you have no loss.  Stop looking at the tape, stop wondering if you made the right decision.  Go sit out on the porch with a beer, or pretend you are on the beach wiggling your toes in the sand, because one day that is right where you will be.

12,Due Diligence on Bitcoin,3246,lx4svz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lx4svz/due_diligence_on_bitcoin/,457,2021-03-04 05:26:57,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year’s near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe’s Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe’s Law, remember?

[https:\/\/www.lookintobitcoin.com\/charts\/wallets-greater-than-1-btc\/](https://preview.redd.it/ndk2uz1t7vk61.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=34386a60c29ff9950d506a7899030441a4220200)

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow “crypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers’ digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry’s path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin’s processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/t74wwd7edvk61.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=86efc9bd3a7aaf40556c7d516779594edc53e884)

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe’s Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

29,DON'T SPEND YOUR BITCOIN ON CONSUMER GOODS!,9,lxw92z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lxw92z/dont_spend_your_bitcoin_on_consumer_goods/,32,2021-03-05 05:44:16,"There are a bunch of companies positioning themselves to accept bitcoin as payment for their products these days (probably more than you would expect), with Tesla being one of the bigger ones as of late.

I've been reading about Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and how he will allow fans to buy tickets for games with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ..

THIS ONLY BENEFITS THE COMPANY RECEIVING THE BITCOIN!!

Bitcoin is scarce and will only become harder to obtain, you will hurt yourself in the long run by 'trading' your bitcoin for a ticket to a basketball game or for a new Tesla model whatever.

It all sounds good that cryptocurrencies in general are becoming more widely adopted and accepted, but in this 'game of accumulation' I can't help but think of the suckers that will spend their bitcoin on things like this.  

I'll reference a tweet from Chamath where he bought a plot of land with bitcoin about 9 years ago.  He paid $1.6m, which is worth over 80x that today ..

Importance of BTC

Big companies like Facebook & Amazon should join the crypto world.

BTC is the solution to the world's economic problems.

FED stopped updating the M2 money printing chart.

Money printer go Brrrrrrrrrr.

More people will own BTC in the future.

For those that want to accumulate BTC in a tax efficient manner via IRAs and Roth IRAs, now is probably a pretty decent time to be picking it up. The discount more than offsets the impact of fees for the first few years AND you get the optionality that it will revert back to a premium like it's traded for most of its history. 

https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav

Or go to the Grayscale site and take BTC per share (currently 0.0009469 BTC per share) and multiply by BTC price if you want to audit the discount yourself.

42,Bitcoin is the ultimate populist movement,39,lxidf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lxidf6/bitcoin_is_the_ultimate_populist_movement/,18,2021-03-04 19:25:07,"Sorry for the length of the following, but just some commentary from someone who follows history and the market:

Populism has been increasingly on the rise in the past decade. Starting with Trudeau in Canada, extending to the 5 Star Movement in Italy, Brexit in the UK, Yellow Vests in France, Trump in the US, the success of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the protests in Russia, etc.

First, defining populism. Populism is basically the idea that the elites have a certain level of treatment that’s reserved for them, that government rules and laws are made and skewed towards their favor, and that the everyday person deserves to be treated just as fairly and equally. 

Its been fairly evident throughout history that lawmakers are biased. Why? Because lawmakers are inherently wealthy (Ted Cruz with net worth of $4mm, Romney with net worth of $250mm, even Elizabeth Warren with her net worth of $12mm). Therefore, in aggregate, the laws that are issued will naturally favor those making the laws. 

As a result of biased lawmakers, industries themselves who are governed by these laws will ultimately favor those at the top. Think private health insurance, financial services, etc. The rule of society is, those who can afford the bigger legal team wins. The GameStop debacle was the latest in a long history of inequalities which shows that the rules that are mandated to the common person don’t apply to the rich. 

Enter Bitcoin, a platform where everyone is regarded equally. Where common day people can invest and grow their wealth at a disproportionate rate relative to stocks, bonds, and traditional assets that the wealthy have loaded up their yachts with. Where the average worker can break away from the traditional hierarchical pyramid, and actually start their own financial ecosystem. Effectively taking power away from those at the top, and spreading it amongst those who hold it. 

Central banks aren’t stupid. They understand how technologically efficient crypto currencies are. That’s why 86% of central banks around the world are experimenting with CBDCs (according to Deutsche Bank IB Research), and why China is live testing theirs as we speak. However, central banks also don’t want to lose power. That’s why they’re extremely cautious of Bitcoin and the traction that it’s garnering, and cautioning against the adoption thereof (think China bans, Yellen FUD, etc.). 

The question therefore becomes, who wins? Will the political and financial elite, who have dictated our current socio-economic constructs rise out on top like they always do and Bitcoin just fades away as a fad? Or will the average person grasp the opportunity that Bitcoin provides to show the 1% that the power of the 99% is a force to be reckoned with, and really change the financial system (and their own net wealth) for the better. 

Only time will tell. But with the continued rise of populism around the world and the idea that the average person should be treated the same as the financial and political elite, Bitcoin is the ultimate vehicle to propel that forward, and it’s no wonder so many at the top are worried.",2021-03-04

They won’t talk about the sacrifices we made to buy bitcoins, while they were wasting their money. They won’t talk about how we saw our portfolios drop in value by 80% while they were “safely” keeping their money in the bank. They won’t talk about how everyone laughed at us when we said we were buying bitcoins or when we asked sellers if they accepted them as a payment method.
