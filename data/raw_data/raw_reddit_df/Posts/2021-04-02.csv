0,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,635,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,228,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

Thereâ€™s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

Convinced we're living in some parallel phantasy where dreams can actually come true..  

The Bitcoin journey must be the craziest, wildest, euphoric and most beautiful rides that most hodlers will be  privileged to have been a part of.

From Satoshi to each and every single one of us that's followed.. we've all played our part in turning the dream in to a reality.

Personally l feel honored and blessed to not only have been alive to witness but also to have played a small part in line of history's greatest revolutions.

Many movies of this moment in history will be made and we will all be the stars.

It's crazy to think that after two world wars, humanity can unite in such a magnificent way and turn the hopes and prayers of the few in to the future salvation of so many.

To all the new-coiners that aren't there already,  I really hope that someday you'll also be able to look back and marvel at the beautiful path you took, proud of the part you played and moved by the legacy you've helped create.

I live in a small mountain town and noticed the Coinstar at the local grocery store lets you exchange cash for BTC. I make cash tips at my job, so I thought this might be a good way to stack a few extra sats. 

I go through the motions on the machine until it tells me to start inserting my cash ($120). Immediately I notice that the exchange rate is much higher than the current price of BTC (at about $63k instead of $59k). Oh well, no big deal, I continue. 4% transaction fee as well? Whatever, fine. Once I get my voucher I have to verify my identity in order to claim my BTC. Again, sure, no big deal I suppose. Finally get everything squared away and receive my sats! (Now worth about $108 after fees) 

Okay, time to move them into my cold wallet as part of the final test. Just another $11.26 in fees to make that happen. Uhh, well damn. After everything was said and done (buying, receiving, and sending to my cold wallet), my $120 is now worth about $97, the price of BTC before and after staying just about the same. 

Feels good to turn my funny paper into some solid sats, but I don't think I'll be doing that again any time soon. Coinbase fees almost seem generous after this experience.",2021-04-03
