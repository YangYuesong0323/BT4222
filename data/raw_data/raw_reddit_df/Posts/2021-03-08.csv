Oil billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke has come out strongly in favor of Bitcoin, as he bets the cryptocurrency will prove the best defense against the disruption facing the finance industry and central banking.

Rokke’s [Aker ASA](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AKER:NO), which controls oil and oil service companies and has more recently branched out into green tech and renewable energy companies, is setting up a new business, Seetee AS, to tap into the potential of Bitcoin, according to a statement on Monday.

“Bit­coin may still go to zero. But it can also be­come the core of a new monetary ­architecture,” Rokke wrote in a [shareholder letter](https://www.seetee.io/static/shareholder_letter-6ae7e85717c28831bf1c0eca1d632722.pdf) on Seetee’s website. He says it’s not inconceivable that one Bit­coin could  one day “be worth mil­lions of dollars.” 

 “Peo­ple who know the most about Bit­coin be­lieve its fu­ture suc­cess is near­ly in­evitable,” Rokke said.

For now, Rokke’s investment will be small, and Seetee will start with just 500 million kroner ($58 million) in capital. The firm plans to keep all its liquid investable assets in the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has continued to divide opinions after a volatile start to the year. A single coin cost more than $57,000 at one point last month, compared with just over $8,000 roughly a year ago. The cryptocurrency has won some notable endorsements of late, including Elon Musk. It’s also been associated with some nail-biting investing moments, with Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management a notable example.

Goldman Crypto Chief Flags Institutional Demand Driving Boom

Aker’s Seetee will focus on investing in Bitcoin, establish partnerships with leading players in the Bitcoin and broader blockchain community, launch Bitcoin verification operations and invest in innovation projects and companies.

The Norwegian industrial company, with roots reaching back 160 years, has been active in investing in industrial software, fintech and green energy value chains. Its latest venture into cryptocurrency is intended to help pursue developments in cyber security, financial transactions and emissions-free verification operations, it said.

“The di­rec­tion is clear: fi­nance will be dis­rupt­ed as sure­ly as fos­sil fu­els will be,” Rokke said. “The question is not if, but when.”",2021-03-08

> On March 3rd, 2021, my husband was out and tried to buy a cheeseburger, when his card declined. He called me to let me know his card was not working and asked if i could get to the bottom of it. I had noticed the previous day, that the app on my phone for our bank, SUNTRUST, was not letting me login as i was trying to check our funds for budgeting, and i assumed the app was being updated so i didn't bother with it. all in all, i ended up calling the customer service phone number on the back of my debit card, which connected me with a representative to whom i explained the current situtation. The representative began to stutter and could barely get a sentence out without placing an ""umm"" between every word, which instantly gave me anxiety. As she procceeded to answer my question as to why my card was not working, she stated ""The account has been closed, Suntrust decided they will no longer continue banking with you as per a 'routine review' of their accounts"". As you could imagine, i was instantly irate, Due to the fact that all of my husband and I's funds were in this one sole account, and i had not recieved ANY notification of closure or review. I instantly hung up the phone, and decided i would go down to my local branch, because surely this was some mistake.

> As i arrived at the branch, i sat down with a banker in a very humid glass office, and kindly explained what the representative had told me on the phone, but that i had no knowledge of why this would have happened. The banker seemed confused as if this had never occured before, and procceeded to pull up my account. As he read over the notes, he remained quiet which i found odd. He turned to me and very plainly stated ""there are no notes in regards to the situtation, im not sure why, there is just a phone number provided for you to contact for more information, im sorry."" and handed me a paper with the said phone number on it.

> I walked out of the building, and called the number in my car from the parking lot. It brought up the automated system for the suntrust fraud department, which then led to me to a representative with an international accent, most likely indian, which led me to assume this was an offshore phone number. I again had to explain my situation and yet AGAIN no explanation could be provided.

> At this point, i was now past anger, and my emotions grew into fear, where is my money!?

> I walked back into the branch, unsatisfied with the service being provided from this institution, and requested to speak with the manager. He politely led me into his office, as i again explained the situation. as the banker before had, the manager pulled my account up and read through what seemed like an endless amounts of notes, yet could not provide an explantion. He stated he had to call the 'back office' who are responsible for account closures, placed the call on speaker but as soon as someone picked up, placed it on a personal call so i could not hear the responses. The manager explained what was going on, and asked ""is there any information that i CAN provide to the client?"" which flew a huge red flag for me.. what do you mean what you can tell me? its my money for god sake, don't hide information.. but anyways, he continued on and could only state that the fraud department was reviewing my account and they decided to close the account. he could not provide any timeframe for when i would recieve my money, but that it would come through a check in the mail. I cried right there unapologetically, this bank took all our money, won't give us access to it online to even verify the amount in the account, and won't provide any further information.

> I have no money to pay the bills, feed my family, put gas in the car. I don't know how this is even legal, as i have seen many other people's testimonies reporting the same, with no luck for a resolution. We had thousands of dollars in this account, and they took it all without remorse or explanation.

> What do we do now? Get a lawyer? How do we pay?

> If this has happened to you, i am so sorry, but this just can't be legal.

> what now.

You get access to it after retirement “supposedly” (I’m doubtful with the current workforce and economical demographic trends) anyhow, there was recently a program that allowed Aussie citizens to withdraw up to $20,000 from their super to help as a covid relief package type thing. I still don’t know why we had to draw down on savings yet the printer went brrrrr and bailed out a lot of big business’.
Anyhow I was lucky enough to be financially okay enough to put half of the $10,000 I had withdrawn into my btc savings account. It’s now up about 300% and I’m sure I wasn’t the only Aussie 🇦🇺 to have done this.

Coinbase for instance limits you to about ~ $25k +/-.
But appart from the limit, what concerns me the most is if those $1.5 billion that tesla bought in btc comes from a single entity or is more like it comes from multiples/independent entities selling btc at the same time.

Do exchange sites like kraken/binance/coinbase really have that much bitcoins (1.5B, individually) ?",2021-03-08

It's only 9 short pages. Most of you will comprehend at least 70% of it upon first reading. The tech can be dense, but the underlying concepts are not.

I've had too many discussions with people who misunderstand underlying fundamentals to Bitcoin, but the misconceptions can all be easily dispelled by reading Satoshi's words.

Also, you can gloat to your friends that you've read the whitepaper (guilty).

I woke up a bit too late with bitcoin (thought about buying in November, but giving birth to a baby took my mind off of it for a while) but still made quite a bit already but I'm thinking it would be probably smart to invest in something else too which is safer, like an etf. But you have to hold them also for a few years at least to have proper gains, and since I believe in bitcoin and will definitely hold at least until the next halving, I am not sure etf is less risky with a much lower gain. What do you guys think? I know I should do something with my money, sitting on a bank account means loosing value.",2021-03-09
