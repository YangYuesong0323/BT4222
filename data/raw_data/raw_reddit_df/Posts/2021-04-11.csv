0,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,1028,krqrmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/krqrmf/bitcoin_newcomers_faq_please_read/,933,2021-01-07 00:06:25,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)
* [Video 1: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://youtu.be/ONvg9SbauMg?t=1)
* [Video 2: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=272s)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://youtu.be/JIxwTx7o_B4?t=1)
* [Video 4: Bitcoin Macro Strategy - Michael Saylor & Ross Stevens](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit/sessions/bitcoin-macro-strategy?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ)
* [Video 5: The Saylor Series - Michael Saylor & Robert Breedlove](https://youtu.be/4rvTppy1qLI?t=1)
* [Video 6: Bitcoin S2FX, S2F and Evolution From Collectible to Financial Asset - Stephan Livera, PlanB & Saifdean Ammous](https://youtu.be/j2cP8k_QUaw?t=1)


Some other great resources include Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [""Bitcoin for Everybody""'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course, Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical), and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s).  Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  

If you are technically or academically inclined check out [developer resources](https://developer.bitcoin.org/) and peer-reviewed [research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg), course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) as well as future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  Some Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [here](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/) and [here](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/).  MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL) and [what you could have earned](https://dontbuybitcointheysaid.com/) if you didn't listen to them!  XD

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin created and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you how much time until the next drop in block rewards.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pwna9/lightning_network_megathread/), a second layer scaling solution currently rolling out on the Bitcoin mainnet.  
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the lightning network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

* [Cash app](https://cash.app/)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [P2P exchange list](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) (decentralized) 

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) or [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""** meaning if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins (shitcoins) are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://getumbrel.com/).  You can view the [global node distribution](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/) for a visual representation of the node network.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in recent Electrum wallet releases
bit | bit | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin (μBTC)
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10000 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100k sats

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

But there are some things I dont understand, for example, isnt it possible for bitcoin to get flipped by other better coin? As btc transaction fees keeps rising and if we ever start to use it as currency of choice for everyday use the network will get very congested and the transaction fees will be unsustainably enormous as btc can do only 7 transactions in second as opposed to other coins which can do million.

Also if btc is pure storage of value, why everyone will want to store their money in bitcoin exactly and not other coin? Because if they make a decision to withdraw some bitcoin and convert it to money to buy something, there will again be very high transaction fee which makes it not worth that and the bitcoin essentially will get stuck on that wallet. I have seen that there is argument that btc is good because it is leaderless, but arent there other coins which are leaderless too?

Also another question, if people who will own 0.01btc will be millonaires, where that puts people who own 1btc, 1 000btc, 100 000btc??? The new ultimate god level illuminati? If btc ever reaches 10million price, someone with 100 000 btc would have 1trillion usa dollars if my math is correct. And there are probably people who own way more bitcoin than that. As opossed to now the richest people have like 120billions or something. Wouldn't they be so  uncomprehensable rich that they would  be able to control the entire world, economics, politics etc. again but now to even more unimaginably bigger scale with just their little pinky?? And manipulate the market to somehow screw over the regular people yet again?

20,"65 BTC were traded last week in Venezuela only using LocalBitcoin (up from 60), these 65 BTC were 7,685,000,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares, national currency ISO VES). One BTC is around 135,000,000,000 Bs. Minimum monthly wage is 1,800,000 Bs. (less than a USD).",179,morc7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/morc7z/65_btc_were_traded_last_week_in_venezuela_only/,31,2021-04-11 22:12:47,"Hi guys, hope you are doing fine!

Jus updating this week numbers.

As I always mention:

&#x200B;

\- These numbers are only using LocalBitcoin that has a public API where you can see the numbers.

\- There has been a decrease in the amount of Bitcoin traded, years ago it was more than 2,000 BTC weekly. Reasons could be: 

 \- People is migrating to other services, specially Binance that since months ago lets you exchange P2P Bolivares with some cryptos (BTC, ETH, DAI, USDT and BUSD) and there you can chance ANY crypto into BNB with no fee, so in theory you can go from DOGE to Bolivares for example. These fees are lower than LocalBitcoin.

 \- With the price increase of the BTC, 65 BTC are around 4,000,000 USD even when a lot more BTC were traded, if you coverted them into Bolivares the amount was around 5-6 million USD, so the drop in BTC has been crazy but in USD not that crazy.

&#x200B;

Minium monthly wage is in fact less  than 1 USD, but average monthly wage (in my research) is around 60-80 USD. Yet  there is people that only ""earn"" that officially. Wages in the public  sector are based in that wage, so a ""high"" rank could earn maybe 20  times minimum wage, that is like 20 USD.

Professors at public university for example. Even with PHD there is no way they can have a wage over 20 USD.

According to some NGO (CENDA is the name) a 5 members family needs around 300-350 USD monthly to ""live"", so do your math.

That people survive with relatives abroad that send remittances (that is where  LocalBitcoin and Binance are important), they do something else to get  extra income and so on. Other important exchanges are AirTM and even Uphold which works here. There are a few national exchanges with a high  KYC (I think only Venezuelan are allowed) like Cryptia and AmberesCoin.

People that use the exchanges is people abroad sending remittances to  Venezuela, store owners with a lot of Bolivares and have to get rid of  them as soon as possible, miners and even the own goverment to circunvent sanctions.

If you don't have anyone can help you or you don't have anything to do, you probably left the country (even walking) or you died (sad but true). You cannot survive with 1 USD monthly.

Like a month ago there were new banknotes released (200,000 - 500,000 and 1,000,000 bolivares), banks have three (3) weeks closed and I haven't seen one of these bills yet. Here things work different as cash is amost not used. 1,000,000 Bs. (highest) bill is less than 0.5 USD. Years ago with the help of a friend in USA (he had some Venezuelan bills there) I was able of shipping some Venezuelan bills to some redditors like Lord\_Saren

Two weeks ago I posted I got COVID, got a lot of support from all reddit. I'm fine, as I said it really got me mild, still I haven't recovered the smell and taste. Even being mild a I spent a lot of money! I think problem here is even if get mild people don't have money to buy even acetaminofen (Tylenol).

As much as I love and respect the man, he wouldn't be able to handle a mobile wallet, let alone a hardware wallet. But he knows how to use PayPal.

I understand the passion around the ""not your keys not your Bitcoin"" motto, and I myself want to have full control over my keys for obvious reasons. At the same time, if we want to see mass adoption one day, we need to recognize there is a steep learning curve here, which puts Bitcoin out of reach for so many people.

So the question when talking to someone like my dad, or a teen who's afraid to lose $500 - which to him amounts to his life savings - due to a wrong manipulation is whether you want them in through the likes of PayPal or Bakkt going later on they'll want to learn more and become more sophisticated, or of you want to see them stay out of what they perceive as an intimidating Bitcoin ecosystem altogether.

Edit: some people here are missing the point. I can and have been educating people around me. My argument is that this doesn't scale, and the ecosystem needs those simplified experiences.

* Is it to achieve lower fees?
* Is it to open a channel as long as possible, and hoping to never close them?

The BTC fees are currently relatively high for microtransactions to take place at the moment, these are just the facts laid out.

Believe me, I'm a long time BTC hodler, and really wishes for Lightning to reach mass adoption, but looking at the stats between BTC and BCH, which one is the better solution to scale say, 10x?

Why not make bigger blocks and integrate layer 2 solutions on top of it? Why must it be binary solution, we can always have the best of both worlds.

Use bigger blocks for short term solution whilst layer 2 solution is under development. Isn't that better?",2021-04-12

1.OPTIMISM.  
It all starts with a positive outlook on the market situation, which leads the trader to open a trade. The trader is looking forward to future success.  


2.EXCITATION.  
The market starts moving in the predicted direction. The trader anticipates events and hopes that success is assured.  


3.TREMBLING.  
The market continues to move in the direction the trader needs, this is a moment of joyful fading. At this stage, the trader is completely confident in his trading system.  


4.EUPHORIA.  
The point of maximum financial risk. Investments turn into quick and easy profit. The trader completely ignores the risk.  


5.ANXIETY.  
Oh no, the market is turning! The first signs of movement not in favor of the trader appear. But he does not notice this and believes that the market will recover and the trend will continue.  


6.NEGATION.  
The expected market recovery did not happen. The trader does not accept what is happening and remains in the position.  


7.FEAR.  
Reality dictates its own rules, and the trader begins to realize that he is not as smart as he previously thought. Instead of confidence in success, thoughts begin to get confused.  


8.DESPAIR.  
At this point, all profits are lost. The trader had a chance to take profit, but he missed it. Not knowing how to proceed further, he is trying to do everything to return at least to the break-even point.  


9.PANIC.  
The most emotional period. At this stage, the trader feels his ignorance and helplessness and is completely at the mercy of the market. The mind is paralyzed, which sometimes leads to meaningless actions in the market.  


10.SURRENDER.  
The trader has reached the limit of patience and closes the position in order not to increase losses anymore.  


11.DESPODENCY.  
After exiting the market, the trader no longer has the slightest desire to conclude deals.  


12.DEPRESSION.  
The trader begins to blame himself for stupidity, for why he did not close the deal on time. Some choose the right path and begin to analyze what went wrong. True traders are born at this stage, studying past mistakes and drawing conclusions.  


13.HOPE.  
“I can still do it!” Eventually, the trader returns to the realization that there are indeed cycles in the market. He begins to analyze new possibilities.  


14.FAITH.  
At this stage, the trader regains faith in his future in the market and starts trading again.",2021-04-12

The funds came into Electrum about an hour ago and I was wondering why, if there is a reason, it would say I don't have the funds, when clearly I do. That's sounds confusing. Let me reiterate, I bought the Bitcoin an hour ago. The transaction went smoothly, I got the Bitcoin into electrum. When I went to buy Monero with it though, it said not enough funds, even though I have the funds. Does electrum freeze the wallet after sales/acquisitions of BTC have happened for a certain amount of time, or am I just fucking stupid?
