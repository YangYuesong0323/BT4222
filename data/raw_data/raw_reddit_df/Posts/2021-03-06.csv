- 3months activation period, 90% hashrate threshold
- if activated, schnorr enablement is 6mo after start
- if not activated, try something else

the longer enablement delay after activation is interesting and reduces the risk from unupgraded nodes on services, miners, wallets, users and gives them time (a risk otherwise increased by short activation window)

while the short activation period avoids delays or perceived indecision resulting in a user-led UASF as SPDY8 is ""fast enough"", and if the unexpected were to happen and miners unreasonably delayed, then it should be easier to find consensus on a flag height activation from there. (actually not clear if BIP 8 or BIP 9, I think BIP 8 is considered an improvement due to use of block heights vs dates which created some subtle problem in the past).",2021-03-06

While acknowledging that circumstances may be different now, this article notes that historically this may signal a bottom for BTC, meaning prices are heading up soon. 

Bloomberg sees BTC marching towards $100k by the end of 2021, and notes that bitcoin is beginning to replace gold as an alternative investment. 

Once it hits $100k, Bloomberg sees BTC becoming less volatile. It sees BTC becoming less volatile than Amazon‚Äôs stock in 2022.

10,Explaining Bitcoin to my 80 year old grandma,87,lz8q1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lz8q1r/explaining_bitcoin_to_my_80_year_old_grandma/,23,2021-03-07 03:10:50,"While visiting my grandparents today we started talking about saving money and investing. I tried to avoid bringing up Bitcoin (as it would be hard to explain to a 80 and 82 year old) so I just told that I have a portion of my savings on an easy to access savings account and another portion is 'invested'. Then my grandpa went 'Well I just hope you don't fall for that Bitcoin scam, they have been sending me spam for a while now'. After telling them I actually did own some Bitcoin my grandma seemed interested and started asking questions on how it could not be a scam.

So in the most simple and easiest way I tried to explain to her how bitcoin works. I know she is a smart lady and that even at her age she can understand a lot of technical stuff (she has her own webshop) so I just went for it. Then in the middle of me explaining on how the blockchain works she interrupted me and said 'Well this all just reminds me a lot of the gold market'. Taken aback a bit I could just grin and say 'yeah.. that is actually a very good comparison'. Then after patting herself on her back calling herself a smart granny she just took over my whole explanation and just started talking about the benefits of a decentralized currency. I wasn't even finished explaining and she just tied the rest of the knots together herself! After she was finished she seemed visibly excited to have learned something new and just said 'Well now it all just makes complete sense, all I can say is that you are now at the right time in your life to be experimenting with something like this, and I'd rather have you buy some Bitcoins than to see you spend it all in a casino'. 

My grandma has always been able to pull me back to earth and has been a voice of reason for me since I can remember. She usually ends up being right about basically anything she says, so to have her be so excited about Bitcoin truly means a lot for me and gives me a lot of extra confidence in Bitcoin itself.",2021-03-07

13,HitBTC is a Scam - Here is Exactly How their Scam Works,256,lyxuup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lyxuup/hitbtc_is_a_scam_here_is_exactly_how_their_scam/,74,2021-03-06 17:04:53,"HItbtc is a scam exchange. Period. Let me explain how the scam works.
HitBTC scams by creating endless obstacles to people trying to access their funds. They make deposits incredibly simple. They make withdrawals incredibly hard. And they do this very opaquely. Crypto deposits NEVER require KYC.
When you sign into HitBTC, there is no indication that KYC is required for withdrawals. In fact, their platform says you can withdraw certain amounts with no KYC. In their ToS though, they make sure to add a clause which says they MIGHT require KYC in certain circumstances. Most users assume that they will be able to withdraw crypto funds without KYC. That is what HitBTC wants you to believe.
There are regulated cryptocurrency exchanges around the world which allow you to withdraw your crypto without KYC. Most of them are much larger than HitBTC. There is no international law, or any type of rule, which requires exchanges to KYC a customer before they withdraw their crypto balance. Especially if they are not involved with fiat trading.
What HitBTC did to me was delete my 2 FA code. They do this often. They delete your 2 FA code (of course, with funds on your account), requiring you to go through 2FA recovery process. This takes ages, and they require a bunch of personal and transaction info. They act as if you lost your 2FA device, but actually, they just manually remove it on their end.
They expect a good amount of people will never be able to complete 2 FA recovery. It's a lengthy process, and their support is slow to answer. They know that for small amounts, a lot of people give up right here. They'll act like they're trying to help you, but really their entire business model revolves around wearing you out. They get a good amount of crypto to keep just from people not being able to complete the 2 FA recovery.
Now, 2 FA recovery can eventually be completed. It'll take a few weeks, maybe months at this point. The customer will think they're getting somewhere. They'll get back into their account, see their crypto balance, they'll feel fairly confident at this point. The support will say there's a 4 day freezing period on your funds, for safety, after which you'll be back to normal.
So you wait the 4 days, and most people will then try to withdraw their funds. 100% of the time, I guarantee, the withdrawal will fail. Even though it's well within the stated withdrawal limits, HitBTC will fail your withdrawal. They won't even tell you why. You'll need to follow up with support.
Support is going to eventually tell you that you need to KYC. They'll quote some bullshit vague legal reason and say hey, we're just following the rules. What rules, HitBTC? You're a sketchy crypto exchange in the fucking Seychelles. You're a faceless organization. There's much larger, much more trusted exchanges who don't have any similar requirement. They are not legally required to KYC you, but they say they must.
So now you're back at their mercy. They'll ask for photo ID, proof of residence, they'll ask about what the coins are for. But not all at once. They'll ask for these things 1-2 at a time, with incredibly slow response times. They'll ask for new versions of the same thing, higher resolution, higher quality, better lighting. They'll wear you down. They will do whatever they can for you to just give up.
That is how they make their money. They make their money by putting endless obstacles between you and your funds, so that eventually you give up. They ask for personal information like photo ID, proof of residence, etc. which can be resold on the dark web, especially when it's a crypto user's documents. These documents can be used to obtain access to your other crypto platforms.
Who does HitBTC think they are? They're a sketchy, faceless, reputation-less shitty crypto exchange in Seychelles. Is it reasonable for them to request your personal information, without the reputation to securely store such information? Surely their requests would be illegal in most jurisdictions. Good luck doing anything about it though. You won't find any real people linked to the HitBTC platform. You gonna go sue their shell company in Seychelles?
So here you are, a year into the process, you've handed over a mountain of your personal information to a scamming, faceless organization who is holding your funds hostage. If you make a big enough stink on social media, and you've completed all of the obstacles, they might in certain cases decide to release your funds. You'll finally withdraw, pay an exorbitant withdrawal fee (USDT was $65 USD last I checked). You'll get your funds out, you'll say, HitBTC wasn't a scam, they're just annoying!
No, HitBTC absolutely is a scam. The scam is to wear down 95% of people. If you're one of the 5% that handed every personal document you have to get back your funds, and attacked them on social, after spending dozens of hours on just getting your funds back, you are just a small cost of doing business. The scam doesn't need to hit 100% of users. It just needs to hit most of them. HitBTC is a scam.",2021-03-06

I mentioned I would be willing to help prove the power, utility, and safeness of BTC as a store of value and begin taking my commission checks in BTC. They said ""if you can tell me how we can do so in a safe, easy, legal (regarding taxes) way, I won't just pay your commissions - I'll *advertise* to the community that we are doing that and begin converting part of our balance..."" etc.

I wasn‚Äôt immediately opposed so as he talked I would ask a question here and there but never outright rejected the idea. Just now my wife asked me if I thought he was big enough for a bow and arrow. Without much thought I just started telling her that I wasn‚Äôt real sure one way or the other and then I started telling her, using my sons similar language from this morning, why he‚Äôs probably ok to have a bow and arrow. After I finished talking she said, ‚Äúyeah he said the same things to me.‚Äù When she said that I realized that even though I was only halfway paying attention to him while I worked my brain still actively heard what he was saying. By halfway listening he convinced me, without me realizing, that he needed a bow and arrow. 

So how the fuck does this apply to crypto you may ask? 

In that moment I realized that sometimes I let Reddit and YouTube do the same thing to me.
