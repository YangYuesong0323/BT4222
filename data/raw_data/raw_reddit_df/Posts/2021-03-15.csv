India Bans Cryptocurrency

India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets. Even China, which has banned mining and trading, does not penalise possession. Holders of cryptocurrencies have up to six months to liquidate.

The draconian bill is believed to give jail of up to 10 years on people who mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose of, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies (1). 


Why? 

Illicit activity with crypto is no longer a valid argument for censorship. It is currently believed to make up less than 1% of Bitcoin transaction activity, a stark contrast to the 2% to 5% of global GDP caught up in money laundering alone. As legitimate cryptocurrency use goes up, crypto crime as a percentage goes down. 2020 crypto crime was $1.9 billion in 2020, down 57% from 2019‚Äôs $4.5 billion (2). 

The Reserve Bank of India voiced its concern again last month, citing what it said were risks to financial stability from cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the central bank has been working on launching its own digital currency, a step the government‚Äôs bill will also encourage.

Quantitative easing (inflation) is seen by governments as imperative for maintaining financial integrity and mitigating financial crisis, despite the negative socio-economic effects associated with the loss of purchasing power (3). 

Bitcoin is immune from both fiscal and monetary policy and avoids the need for cross-border foreign exchange transactions. The Indian government is therefore likely banning cryptocurrency eliminate competition, centralising financial power and imposing inflation and monitoring on national digital currency users. 


Implications

Governments acting to improve the well-being of a community often make misjudgements, unintentionally creating ‚Äúalmost as much harm in ruining lives and destroying wealth as the most destructive wars‚Äù(4).  

The proposed ban on crypto will be particularly damaging to the already poor financial inclusion in India. A World Bank study that found there were over 1.7 billion unbanked adults in 2017 (5). 

It is unlikely that other governments will follow in India‚Äôs steps. However, for institutional investors to participate in a new asset class, it must be underpinned by a robust infrastructure able to support an efficient market, so more regulation is expected. Governments themselves are being pressured and many are re-considering their own currency offerings (6). 

Bitcoin's global reach and neutrality could spur it to become the currency of choice for international trade (7). It is almost impossible for a government to shut down access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies or prevent its ownership or usage without what would effectively amount to a shutdown of the global Internet (8). Today, access to the Bitcoin network is enabled by satellites in areas with unreliable or no Internet connection, which further reinforces its censorship-resistant properties (9). India‚Äôs poor policy making simply slows national institutional adoption. 

September 2017 was the last time Bitcoin suffered a pull back from a government banning it (China). Spot price went from $5000 to $3000 before proceeding to run up to $20,000 in the following months. If anything this proves the resilience of decentralised currencies.",2021-03-16

32,Bitcoin is a human right,42,m5o8hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m5o8hu/bitcoin_is_a_human_right/,6,2021-03-16 00:14:14,"Do countries realize how authoritarian it is to restrict the use of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a human right. The right to choose your currency is a human right.

One reason for skyrocketing Bitcoin adoption is that Bitcoin, born out of the global financial crisis, is an expression from the people that they are lacking confidence in the government's ability to manage the money supply fairly and appropriately. The lack of confidence is often caused by the government increasing the money supply (inflation) in a non-proportional manner, meaning that when new money enters the system you do not receive an equal portion of that newly issued money relative to the current portion of the money supply you currently own. This non-proportional issuance reduces your portion of the money supply and is the reality in which we all live: a system in which central authorities attempt to manage fiat currency and seemingly arbitrarily select winners (institutions and people) by rewarding newly created money. Governments may have the best intention when inflating the money supply, but ultimately this is an unjust exercise.

It is important to note that inflation, put simply, is the increase in the money supply. Too many people argue over the *measurement of* and *change in* the prices of good and services, which is a distraction. If the money supply inflated and you did not receive your fair share than you came out on the losing end. On the periphery inflation may take many forms, including a reduction in your purchasing power and/or a widening wealth gap. In any event, people have the right to store their savings as they see fit. 

It is greatly bothersome to see news of countries applying restrictions (or trying to apply restrictions) on their citizens' use of Bitcoin. The most recent news being that India will propose a law banning the use of cryptocurrencies for their citizens. However, we have seen signs of progressive integration of Bitcoin in political pockets of France and the United States *(please add other positive developments from other countries in the comments)*.

How can the Bitcoin community, and those not a part of the Bitcoin community but understand that  *choice of currency* is a human right and an expression of freedom, protect our global peers from authoritative actions? *(please share your non-violent ideas in the comments; I have always believed Bitcoin to be a non-violent, pacifist movement. One attraction of Bitcoin is that the military industrial complex becomes unaffordable with a money supply that cannot be whimsically inflated.)*

*Centralized, active management* of the money supply was always a daunting task that would require an omniscient supervisor, making the long-term management of the money supply impossible, which is precisely why countries should look to openly embrace Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin frees government from the burden of actively managing the money supply. And while government may obtain a certain power and control from being the sole-authority over the money supply make no mistake that there is also a great responsibility and burden in managing the supply too. Additionally, we need to ask ourselves should government have that monopolistic control over money? Bitcoin is a human right.

With the integration of Bitcoin into a country's monetary system, political figures no longer would have their feet held to the fire for the mismanagement the money supply. Citizens, in theory, would make a choice to hold centrally planned fiat or bitcoin. If the fiat money were to devalue against bitcoin, or vice versa, the citizen would have made the choice and accepted the responsibility of their decision to participate in the monetary network of their choosing.

Looking through a pragmatic and idealistic lens of the monetary networks a citizen would choose between there are two broad options:

* **Centrally planned fiat monetary system**\- centralized, opaque-at-best, easily inflatable, providing a lender of last resort and other forms of centralized insurance
* **Bitcoin network**\- decentralized, transparent, sound, calculable modest inflation schedule that eventually levels out, does not provide a lender of last resort (in theory a central bank could start buying bitcoin and build up massive reserves to act as a lender of resort, although they would not have the ability to increase the supply of bitcoin, making this system very different than the current)

There are economic theories justifying both networks. Any rational person would find it hard pressed to make an argument why 100% of your savings should fall into the centrally planned fiat system if Bitcoin was given a fair playing field. 

Countries that embrace Bitcoin will position themselves to lead the human race for the next century and possibly centuries. How should countries embrace Bitcoin? *(please share your ideas in the comments)*

1. **Coexistence of Bitcoin and government issued fiat**: government would continue to issue their own fiat paper and bring Bitcoin into parity with their own fiat legal and compliance structures. There would be no prohibitive measures with regards to mining, ownership, transactions, taxes, etc.. on bitcoin that did not apply to their own fiat. Government could decide if they wanted to accept taxes in fiat, bitcoin or both. 
2. **Bitcoin as a unit of account:** a country decides they no longer want the responsibility and burden of managing a money supply, opting to make bitcoin their unit of account and accept bitcoin as tax payment. The government would transition resources from money supply management to protecting and advocating for the Bitcoin network on behalf of their citizens.",2021-03-16
