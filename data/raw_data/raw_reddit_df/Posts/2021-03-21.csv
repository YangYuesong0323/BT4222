0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,407,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,159,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09

The population of the Earth is *7 879 275 500* people. Emission of bitcoin *18 659 618*. The price of bitcoin at the time of this writing is $*58528*. Satoshi per person on Earth: *236,819*, which is $138.6 at current price.  
Each year, the price of entry into the 1% of humanity that owns bitcoin will be higher and will soon become unaffordable for most of the population.  
It is convenient to look at these statistics [here](https://satoshisperperson.com/).

By buying Bitcoin for $139 today, you will be, on average, richer than the rest of the world's population. Moreover, the amount of bitcoin per person will decrease every day. And you will become richer.

*The price of one dollar is 1718 satoshi. Let's save this statistic to return to it in half a year.*

But the here is the most interesting thing:

Today, **Bitcoin has become the third currency in the world, bypassing the Japanese yen.** Only the Euro and the US Dollar are ahead. Only money is involved in the calculation, in free circulation in the aggregates M1 and M2, that is, all bills and coins issued for free circulation without taking into account deposits in banks and derivatives.

In order to catch up with the US dollar and become the number one currency in the world, bitcoin needs to grow only 2 times to the price of $ 120K per bitcoin.

Could anybody share any advice on where to start learning? A place where I could gradually understand concept like you would explain a 5yr old lol.

The CEO also used a patronising excuse : 'Bitcoin is too volatile'.

  
Now, I want to repeat this: it was a meeting in a Software Company. Most of the people working in the company are Developers, the kind of people who knows about Bitcoin, and should be able to understand it.

20,I purchased some BTC 4 years ago after being given some advice and knowing very little about it and still not knowing much. But the problem now is a modest deposit has now become a lot of money and I am nervous.,71,m9ynq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m9ynq0/i_purchased_some_btc_4_years_ago_after_being/,91,2021-03-21 23:11:11,"I am one of these people who know very little about Bitcoin while at the same time keep a close eye on what clever(and not so clever) people comment  about it's progress. 4 years ago now I took some advice and purchased some Bitcoin using the easiest method open to me and fr my IT skill level(which is low)

I used a fair sum of money to buy some BTC, but not so much that I wouldn't get over it after 2 days pissed off if I lost it all to then return to normal life, my plan was just to buy and hold and even after the early 2018 massive pullback I barely lost a minutes sleep.

I used a popular online wallet for the time that is still operating today and very user friendly and hardly looked at my account/wallet it until this last year. My problem now is(and it's a nice problem) is that my initial ""fair sum of money"" has now grown into a lot of money, life changing sum of money even.

All of a sudden and after 4 years not really caring about the workings of Bitcoin I am now getting a little concerned about it's security and more so after just a few hours researching online. I have something called and ID number for my wallet where I need a password to get in and then apparently my wallet holds ""the keys"" which I assume are the several Bitcoin purchases I made 4 years ago.

In short I now want to know about how to make it secure, I have heard about hardware wallets etc, I want to know how to move BTC from one wallet to another or someone elses wallet, how to cash out, how to cash out with as smaller costs as possible, though my intention is still to hold for a while yet.

Before the critics jump in I am 60 years old and my IT is OK but not brilliant, I have just treated Bitcoin like a share/stock when I should have been doing so much more, which I will now remedy.

So I am looking for an idiots guide for what I have just mentioned, a good book or website where I can get a full understanding in the next few days and then get it out of the online wallet that I now know I should not be risking because of the dangers.

Keys, Bitcoin transactions and payments, unique numbers it is all gobbledygook to me and I am terrified should I try and move any of it I will end up moving it into someone else's wallet never to see it again, but I am sure it is not that scary once you know what you are doing",2021-03-21

One BTC is around 104,000,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is 1,800,000 Bs. (less than 1 USD).",51,m9yc3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m9yc3v/updating_the_numbers_last_week_the_traded_amount/,9,2021-03-21 22:55:24," Hi guys, as you know Venezuelan living here, crypto enthusiast like to post these weekly updates.

Around 4,000,000 USD in trades (71 BTC at 60k)

This is ONLY using LocalBitcoin (Trades there are mostly Bolivares to BTC and BTC to Bolivares).

Months  ago Binance started P2P trades with  Venezuelan bolivares, I think some  people migrated there (it lets you  trade other cryptos). Also AirTM is  used as exchange too. There are other exchanges (Even local ones like  Cryptia and AmberesCoin). I don't have a way of measure the  daily/weekly/monthly trade there so that is why I use LocalBitcoin as  reference.

* Who  trades BTC to Bolivares? People that needs to pay in some places where   crypto is not accepted. Where do these BTC come from? Could be miners,   could be people abroad that send money to their families in Venezuela,  could be the goverment itself (sadly), people with crypto savings, etc.
* Who   trades Bolivares to BTC? People that gets insane amounts of Bolivares   (like store owners), people that get paid in Bolivares, and want to   convert them in something better and stable than Bolivares digitally and   easy.

A  big chunk of  the population that works for the goverment (around 3 millions) have a  monthly  wage of around 1-10 monthly minium wages, monthly minimum wage  is  around 1 USD (recently increased). So that would put that people  from 1 to 10 USD  monthly. There is also a food bonus that is the same  than the wage.

But the ""average"" wage is around (in some research) is around 60-80 USD.

According   to a NGO (CENDAS) a 5 members family need around 350 USD monthly to   ""live"", yes if you are from USA, Canada, Australia, Germany that amount   is ridiculous low, but that is a standar in Latin America, problem more   that what you need to spend are the WAGES, they are crazy low. A  really  good wage here is around 400 USD monthly (in my opinion).

39,Bitcoin: The greatest story ever told,4,ma8013,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ma8013/bitcoin_the_greatest_story_ever_told/,1,2021-03-22 06:34:52,"I first heard about bitcoin from a dear friend, in 2013 but I thought it would never catch up so I didn’t buy any.

I then started my bitcoin journey reading and learning on this subreddit in 2017, when btc surged past the previous ath of 1000 usd, and I started buying some with the cash I had available which wasn’t much.

At the time (in 2017) I still had a high time preference (fiat mentality) 

If bitcoin would’ve touched 30k back than i would’ve sold all my bitcoin to buy an expensive sport car.
I would’ve struggled to pay the gasoline for such a car and today I’d have no bitcoin.

Instead bitcoin crashed, I had to focus completely on my 9-5 job that doesn’t pay me much but it helped me stack some more sats during the 2019 bear market.

During the last couple of years my mind slowly changed and I started to learn how much bitcoin was actually worth.

Reading you guys here on Reddit but also on Twitter definitely helped a lot and I changed (the bitcoin standard is a great book by the way... thanks @saifedean).

Now I’m confident when I say that I’ll never sell my BTC for Fiat or for shallow cars or stuff I don’t really need.

The [Neo/Morpheus Meme](https://i.redd.it/3525lt9kvir01.jpg) was true after all.

I fully expect another bear market to happen and it will suck because my bitcoin stash will be worth significantly less at some point, but I accept that 100%

Bitcoin gave me hope, freedom and taught me how important savings are for my future, and the future of my kids, that I really want to have in the next few years.
That’s where I’ll probably end up spending my bitcoin.
Raising kids will be a great adventure and I understand now that, in the past, I really thought that I’d never could’ve afforded them.

That’s why my generation (millennials) have so few kids... we just learn this high time preference mentality that we will never be able to afford kids and so we might as well burn money on shallow stuff we don’t need....

Central banks convinced us that there is no future for us, that in the long run we are all dead anyways, so we should just party and spend money until it’s over.

They are destroying our world and we are not even fighting because people don’t even realize what’s going on.

I hope bitcoin will succeed... I really do. And I’ll just go down with the ship if it comes down to that.

I don’t freaking care about taking profits that don’t mean shit if they can print money indefinitely.

Hodl on folks, we have a good shot at this, and I hope many more people will wake up. 

I believe in Bitcoin, it can truly change the world, and I’m putting my money where my mouth is (80% of my net worth is in bitcoin) and I will never sell.

Thank you",2021-03-22

As long as the government doesn't interfere then your are a part of a historical change in our financial system and its corruption.
