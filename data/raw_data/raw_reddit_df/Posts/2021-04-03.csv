0,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,698,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,242,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

There‚Äôs a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

They‚Äôre 1099ing me on the whole amount at purchase price. Waiting on the contract to be sent over. 

Is this real life?

**edit**: Thanks for all the interest! I really love this community. 

Lots of good talk about taxes, yes they are thing, yes I know that, yes I‚Äôm prepared for it. It factors into my thinking. (I have a boating accident planned exactly 12 months from now!) (edit: surprisingly many people don‚Äôt recognize that‚Äôs a joke...)

More importantly though, the two biggest things that recently convinced me I just had to do this, and I want to share, are:

1) I bought something on Amazon with Bitcoin using https://paywithmoon.com/ and the process was as exciting as the first time I downloaded a song with Napster. (Edit edit: this is definitely not the company I work for btw, someone clever suggested that)

2) I also read the piece ‚ÄúMasters and Slaves of Money‚Äù by Robert Breedlove (https://breedlove22.medium.com/masters-and-slaves-of-money-255ecc93404f) and it finally clicked: if someone can manufacture something for nothing and then get you to exchange your life for that thing, then you are a slave. It was true when the Europeans made aggry beads to buy Africans for the slave trade, and its true when the Federal Reserve and the Commercial Banks create monetary units by just pushing a button. Like a conscientious objector simply cannot fire a weapon, I simply cannot trade my time for slave money ever again.",2021-04-03

If you want to stack as many sats as you can, here are some friendly tips:

Put off that new iPhone, car, PlayStation, üëú, whatever.

Rent somewhere cheaper (if it‚Äôs safe, don‚Äôt sacrifice your safety for money).

Eat more vegetables and less meat (cheaper and better for you and the environment)

Switch your phone plan to a non premium carrier without unlimited data. Use more WiFi.

Cut your auto insurance rate if you have a car by shopping around or reducing the miles you drive or both.

Buy no random stuff. Only buy things you can express a true need for.

Make your food at home, stop buying food out and use only the necessary ingredients. Rice is cheap and so are oats, beans, eggs/egg whites and veggies.

Make sure you‚Äôre only carrying one tv streaming service.

Get out of credit card debt completely (interest rate is too high) and if you can‚Äôt control credit card spending, put limits on your card. Consider a balance transfer to a 0% apr card if you have too much debt to pay off.

If you have not gone to college, advance your education at a local community college. Don‚Äôt do this until you are ready to work your hardest to get good grades. You can‚Äôt unfuck your transcript, so treat it carefully.

If you don‚Äôt like school, pursue a trade like plumbing or electricians
 apprentice or general contracting/carpentry. 

Get in shape! Health care is expensive and the less you need to use it, the better. 

If you don‚Äôt have enough money to invest in bitcoin, bitcoin will not solve everything for you. But you can find other ways of escaping poverty if you truly focus, live frugally, and take it one day at a time. You can do this üíØ",2021-04-04

They get outcasted and labeled as not a true ‚ÄúHODLer‚Äù because you‚Äôre supposed to support the bigger cause of total decentralization and complete transfer of wealth.

What I am trying to iterate is that just because you sold all or a portion of your bitcoin allocation, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get back in again and continue to HODL.

Imagine another COVID crisis comes under Bitcoin standard. Countries would have to go to the commercial lending market to borrow the money, instead of simply issuing debt. Safe to say, you‚Äôd never see a stimulus the size of the current one. Maybe countries like US would be able to borrow the same amount, since they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood for it‚Äù, but imagine Argentina. Am I misunderstanding something, or are we all basically in agreement about the economics at play here?",2021-04-04
46,High performance search capabilities in a Bitcoin node implementation,2,mjjzt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjjzt9/high_performance_search_capabilities_in_a_bitcoin/,7,2021-04-04 07:29:14,"Where can I find a Bitcoin node implementation, which is capable of thousands of searches per minute, without degrading performance of the node?

I am aware of two Bitcoin node implementations.

1. [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)
2. [Bitcoin Ops btcd](https://github.com/bitcoinops/btcd)

I am looking for a BTC node implementation, which implements higher performance search capabilities, so I can search using syntax similar in capabiilty to SQL.  I understand why LevelDB was chosen in the Bitcoin Core implementation (not sure what is used in the btcd implementation), but search performance does not stand up to my use case of executing thousands of searches (using bloom filters) per minute, [as described here](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/transaction-bloom-filtering/).

I have written a searchable database back-end using PostgreSQL, but its database must be pruned in order to archieve the high performance I require, which is not optimal.  Thinking out loud, it seems like a NoSQL database like Cassandra, MongoDB, or the like might be better suited to this use case.  But, I have not been able to find a Bitcoin implementation, which uses a NoSQL or comparable database.

With that that in mind, does anyone know of a Bitcoin, or altcoin, node, which meets my use case?",2021-04-04

In my desperation, I met this cheap con u/kathleenanna01. She suggested we do p2p for the obvious reasons. Since I was a bit skeptical I transferred to her coins worth $20 and was hoping to open more trades in the future if she would be trustworthy. Unfortunately, this hungry cheap con has refused to send me the little amount and has since gone mute! She used to be so outspoken here and would comment in every post.
