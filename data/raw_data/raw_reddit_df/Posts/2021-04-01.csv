0,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,570,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,207,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

There’s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

I have about 10k saved in the stock market and am strongly considering lumping this into bitcoin, as from what I'm hearing the bull run is potentially only half way through so not much point waiting for dips and corrections when at the moment, there's so much demand and it seems impossible to time the market. 

I am self employed and run my own business. Make about 2.5k a month and get about 1.5k profit a month.  I  still live with my parents at 23 as I finished uni last year,  so basically have no real commitments or anyone depending on me.

Don't worry, it's fairly short.

4/1/2019, I had been watching the price of bitcoin go up and down for two or three months now, finally got verified on coinbase, and made my first purchase.  0.02413919 BTC @ $4,136.78 or right around $100.  That's all I could spare at the time and I figured if I could trade it day by day and make something like +$20 from it, that's really the best I could ever ask for.

What happened next sent chills down my spine.  I had studied the charts and had watched the price for months thinking I'd be ready for anything bitcoin threw at me, but as I sat there on day 1 of my new adventure, I witnessed the price jump around 25% to $5,150 in a single night.  Of course the... whatever you want to call me... that I was, I sold rather early and missed out on a majority of that amazing jump.

About 2 months went by and I continued to buy and sell during this time, learning how to read the charts better and try to predict how to make an extra dollar (and how not to quickly lose several...)  Money got tight and I was ready to cash out.  Think I made a profit of $80 or so overall from day trading, so of course I was insanely pleased with my little experiment.

Hindsight is 20/20.  If I had just bought into bitcoin and held the entire time, I would have made something like 2.2x what I put in, instead of 1.8x.  If I had continued holding until today, it'd be closer to 14x if not a little higher...  Moral of the story?  HODL!!!  I'm just glad I was one of the fortunate few that was able to turn a profit on day trading.

Recently got back into bitcoin and looking forward to seeing where this technology goes from here.  Can't believe it's been 2 years, but at the same time I thought it'd take decades to get to the prices we're seeing right now.  Still can't say it's a great time for my wallet, but it's about time I jump back on the bitcoin rocket.",2021-04-02

Right now if you are a bitcoiner you probably think: I kind of get it or I get it.

If you a pure speculator that's bullish, you might think I don't agree with it, but I won't fight a crowd.

The reason most are not involved is because it forces them to fake an uncomfortable set of realities. We are getting a look under the hood-and we don't like what we see. Most people do NOT want to think/talk about this.

1. The American political system is beyond repair. It's dysfunctional and polarized to the point of all votes being along party lines. Party dissent is getting less common. This is not good.
2. We cannot stop printing for years to probably forever. We can and will slow down but we won't stop, we must print. We must incur deficits. Even in a recovered economy, a trillion yearly deficit is common. 
3. Europe-no one knows how bad the problems really are. Could be not a huge problem, could be massive.
4. Either the companies and people buying or they are smarter than us and see something coming. This is 08 part 2 and the smart people see the wreck coming. Are the rich all in on the stock market?
5. The debt is going to hurt the 2022-2025 recovery. We must print more to counteract this. 
6. Massive wealth inequality is spreading. Poverty and violence are increasing. Homelessness is rampant. These are signs that point to destabilization.
7. Wages Increase/Cost of living Increase ratio. Anything under 1 means the person is getting poorer. This is rapidly going under 1 and closer to zero for a larger and larger part of society.
8. The only real avenue to stop this is cut expenses. There is nothing that can be cut significantly without a huge shock. 1/6 people work for the government. It costs $400,000+ to house a prisoner for 1 year in NYC.
9. The bond market is in serious trouble if inflation picks up. SERIOUS TROUBLE. Talking 50 trillion trouble. If this recovery is great for 3 months then crashes, a serious economic slow down will force a highly leveraged consumer and corporate borrower to default. The commercial real estate will implode. The government will have less revenues, and face a problem where printing goes insane. I'm talking one time check to everyone for $5,000 insane. I'm talking 0 down 40 year home loans waive 1/2 the pmi interest insane.
10. What's the chance the EU/Europe/China/Russia has a major conflict or a currency collapse. Will people dump treasuries? Find out on the next 6 months episodes of the world of tomorrow.",2021-04-02

That takes a while for most people to fathom. That is how indoctrinated we are.

In fact, the bank can do whatever they want with the money you’ve given them. It is theirs now.

What you have is an IOU.
Except the IOU has no sum printed on it. The one that owes you money keeps track of the amount (because you don’t, right?)

So you don’t keep a ledger, and, in fact, I doubt you even have a printed IOU.

Buying btc from Robinhood is similar. Not your coins. What you have is an IOU.

Both of these can fail, get hacked or asked by governments not to pay to you.

You might have a system that works as an insurance against failures. Still you rely on the failing party to name the amount.

I'm completely new here, but I would like to know, if this is important for you to have a ""clean"" bitcoin, so you know your wallet is safe ? have you ever faced with a situation, of having problems after buying a coin from shady platforms?

with what programs you check it? 

thanks for all answers. ",2021-04-02

If you guys believe bitcoin will reach a marketcap of a 100 trillion usd (most likely it will) in 10 years, then you guys better stack some SATS. Either be it 1 dollar every month or 100 dollar every month. Just keep buying bitcoins for the coming 10 years.
