As part of their agreement, part of his wage is paid out in bitcoin.

Russel Okung's comments on bitcoin are spot on:

""Money is more than currency; it's power. The way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in Bitcoin is the 1st step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.""

""When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create … In a post-fiat world, you won’t have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.""

When you have a quarter of the broad money supply being created in less than a year, it is clear that the money printer determines what value is in the first place. If you receive constant government bailouts, either because your company is highly in debt or it secures many jobs, you're never ever going to do anything but to keep your company ""system-relevant"". You're not going to innovate. You're not even competing anymore.

Debt and the money printer killed capitalism.. risk of investing capital is only for the little guy now because they're not relevant enough for the system. Just give them a shitty paying job that we maintain for them at the mercy of our money printer while asset prices inflate away and out of reach.

The money that's being printed creates more debt than actual GDP. They have to stop but they can't.",2021-02-25

**Projects in this space:**

The first project mentioned is **MintGreen** ([link](https://mintgreen.co/)), who have collocated with Vancouver Island Sea Salt and Shelter Point Distillery to make use of their waste heat for producing salt and whiskey. It doesn't get much more Bitcoiner than that, MintGreen.

Another cool application is a pilot project from **Genesis Mining** in Sweden, where they're directing waste heat into a greenhouse used to grow fruits and vegetables and improve local self-sufficiency. Many of Genesis' locations around the world are powered by renewables.

I suspect people think they're comparing apples to apples when seeing the price and saying, ""Oh, the price is about this same, but this one has cheaper management fees, so I'll buy it.""  They may even think they're getting a bargain at the slightly cheaper price.

Grayscale's premium right now is 0.5%, while Osprey's is 165%!.  It's going to take a hell of a long time for your 1.5% difference in management fees to make up for paying 165% premium!  If you've bought Osprey recently without realizing what you were getting, sell it NOW and buy GBTC.  You'll get nearly triple the underlying bitcoin exposure for the same price.

There is just one tiny little problem: pretty much all the developers AND *all* the big mining pool operators prefer LOT=false. This means, LOT=true isn't really an option. STOP asking for it!

Developers don't want to be perceived as being able to force soft forks through via standard settings that lead to automatic activation without any further action by users or miners.
This is important! Otherwise, powerful actors like nation states could start putting pressure on developers to implement soft forks that hurt privacy for example!

The quickest way forward is to just go with LOT=false ASAP and in the off chance, that miners don't activate Taproot quickly, users and industry players will hopefully start running LOT=true clients quickly and Taproot will just activate no later than 1 year after signaling started.

Any other way forward or any more debates will just delay the whole thing! There is just nothing to win by discussing this any further.
