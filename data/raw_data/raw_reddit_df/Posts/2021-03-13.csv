0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,257,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,83,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09

Ok, there's more to it than that. Yes, I bought .04 Bitcoin for $100 in 2017. Surely I was pissing the $100 away because an imaginary internet coin couldn't possibly be worth that much.

I watched Bitcoin rocket to $20k, crater to $3k, and bounce back. Then, in early 2020 my outlook changed drastically. To my surprise, it was doggedly holding onto a $10k valuation. To rise and fall and years later be back up so high...that is not how a bubble on a weak asset plays out.

That's when I made a much larger purchase, giving Bitcoin a real place among my assets. I've accumulated more value on that purchase than any other investment of mine in the same time span.

But without that $100 purchase in 2017, I wouldn't have gained the education. And without the education, I never would have had the conviction to buy a more meaningful amount in early 2020.

The point of all this is that micro-sized investments are much more meaningful than you might think. What's $100 if it enables you to acquire knowledge or experience that makes you much more money down the line?

So, if you are too unsure about putting thousands of dollars into Bitcoin, try $100...or maybe $50...or $10. Whatever you are comfortable with.
