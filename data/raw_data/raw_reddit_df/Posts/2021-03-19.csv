0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,379,m16uon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,143,2021-03-09 21:54:44,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption üëá

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ‚¨áÔ∏è

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",2021-03-09
