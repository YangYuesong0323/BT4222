1,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,208,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,63,2021-03-25 02:43:38," There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds

There’s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password. 

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.",2021-03-25

Think again.,473,meyr8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/meyr8s/yall_noobs_think_your_gov_can_ban_crypto_think/,233,2021-03-28 18:15:25,"This is a rant and I apologize beforehand for hurting feelings and not choosing the best words. I'm drunk and I need to have a word with you noobs. I've seen people discussing the possibility that governments could ban Bitcoin and *omg how bad the big gov controls everything! What if they outlaw it? Or tax it? Or regulate it? Or kill the exchanges???*

Let me say it clear: most of you cyber noobs have no effing idea what cryptography, decentralized networks like the torrent network, and ultimately crypto currency are capable of.

You're thinking in legacy system terms. You're thinking, ""Oh no the economic value of my coins can go down because they control the exchanges"". You don't get it. Maybe you don't even realize what your crypto actually is. For many of you, crypto is a vehicle to attain more power in legacy meat space. I get it, it's hard to think outside of the box and think beyond your own cognitive barriers. But it's way bigger than what your frightened, conditioned, slave mentality brain can even start to grasp.

What crypto doesn't do, among other things:

* it doesn't care what your exchange rate is
* it doesn't care how good your on and off ramps are
* it doesn't care about your local law
* it doesn't care about censorship
* it even doesn't care about any of your meat space physical boundary conditions, other than the hash rate, connectivity, and the network topology of the network

It's a fucking cyber honey badger but most of you guys are stuck with their mind in the ""but but but what if the big guys take it away from us"" mindset. I'm so happy that the success of this project does not depend on whether people's feelings are aligned with the cryptographic reality of it. 

Let me add only this: if it were possible to turn this thing off, It would be turned off already. None of your govs would have let it become what it is now. If they could have. They have tried to kill the torrent network for ages. Guess what, I've just seeded another terabyte this month. And I'm going to keep doing it, even if it means that I need to get a freaking satellite internet connection for doing so.

15,I never ever believe in my retirement fund,332,meuy1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/meuy1v/i_never_ever_believe_in_my_retirement_fund/,123,2021-03-28 13:02:55,"I have worked some 20 years as an engineer. Ever since I started working, I had this gut feeling that I would never get enough for retirement, that there would be depreciation, that the system might collapse.

I grew up in a third world country, and I remember my father being VERY upset because of an 80% devaluation -overnight. He had his debts in usd, so we were financially screw. I was very young, did not even knew math, but when he literally eli5 the situation for my, I had complete understanding of the situation.

He owe 10 american bananas and needed about 20 local bananas to pay. But now our bananas were cheaper and he needed 100 bananas to pay for the 10 american bananas. And we only had about 30, so we needed 70 extra bananas and that is how my sister, his wife and the girl she find in a forest ended up working in the streets at night, to get most needed bananas for us.

**Joke aside**, I never in my life see my family being so miserable overnight.

In 2014, there was ""a voice"" telling me to buy btc. I did not even understood what it was but I buy in and after the crash, I sold and lost (7 btc).

2015, when the price went up again, the voice kept telling me to buy and I did. I kept doing that and in 2018, after the crash, I did not sell. I understood it was a cycle.

And oh boy, are 3 years long? They are.

But I kept buying, every month a little bit.

If anything, I regret I did not put all my savings there. I kept accumulating satoshis.

During this bullrun, I got probably 3x what I have in my retirement fund already, and I am not planning to sell like I did in 2015.


Another thing I realize while growing up is that both my grandparents had big houses and a number of cars, and my father could only afford a tiny house and 1 car, and myself? I was never willing to get a credit to pay in 30 years for a house half the size of my parents and move on public transport. The system was obviously not working.

All the fears that I had when I was a kid came back to hunt me. Devaluation is not just a phenomenon of third world countries.

Today I do not give a fuck anymore about my retirement money. I am much more upset that the government takes taxes from the risk that I took since 2014. While they keep devaluating the money a little bit every year to a lot sometimes, they want us to pay for they stupid games. And all along, the people who make the rules, politicians backed by big money, keep doing more money.

Is this a rant?

TLDR, I never believe in my retirement fund.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This  is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date,  since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a  lot of people are moving to Binance.

There  are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones  (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A  big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of  between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They  need to do something else to survive.

I  think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but  still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

On  a personal note, I got COVID, I did think it was just a flu but days  ago I lost my taste and smell. Here there is no easy way of getting PCR  test and there is not nationwide vaccine plan, goverment says ""f\*ck you,  save yourself you are in our own"". I'm resting and I hope I didn't  infect people close (like my parents :().

I  spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins,  acetaminophen   and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS (cryptocurrency points) have helped me a  lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon  :()

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE
* 0.2 NANO

43,BITCOIN The Gold of Future,2,mfct2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mfct2a/bitcoin_the_gold_of_future/,8,2021-03-29 07:33:26,"Enough of the fad, a lot of rhetoric around Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat. That's overtly over rated, perhaps, my mind is going there. Would you or anyone else like holding a currency that appreciates by 5% today and depreciates by 8% to 10% tomorrow.  Or, simply put, its sailing in the tumultuous ocean of volatility. 

We are getting mislead perhaps by false image positioning of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. 

So, what's Bitcoin then? 
It's a perfect form of programmable money or a decentralized financial system. On top of this, Bitcoin is the best example of ""store of value."" Perhaps, the rhetoric should move to Bitcoin instead of gold. 
What's the growth? Something that clicks my mind. 

An unprecedented and dominating track record nevertheless. 
Bitcoin, 48,25,525% of growth in the last one decade. Gold, dwarfed by the shine of the golden-bit-goose at 900%. 

Best time to make gold bugs question their move now.",2021-03-29

The guy is from africa and pretending to be in DC and is asking people to send him bitcoin  to invest.
I didn't get scammed but I revealed the dude and he just blocked me. I did report his account but pls do the same. I'm trying to help others and protect them.

45,Why comparing BTC to gold is stupid.,2,mfcqub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mfcqub/why_comparing_btc_to_gold_is_stupid/,7,2021-03-29 07:29:52,"I see a lot of people comparing BTC to gold and in how we could compare BTC's value to gold's value as a store of wealth.  

This is inherently flawed.  A vast majority of people who own phones and could potentially have a crypto wallet **do not in any shape or form have the ability to invest in gold.**  

Gold also has almost no purchasing power.  I know we've heard this one before but no one carries around quantities of gold that can actually pay for things easily.  Sure I can go into Best Buy and offer the cashier my Rolex(TM) for the Vizio TV I'm buying but they most likely won't even consider taking the deal.

BTC/Crypto will overtake Gold as a store of wealth.  Full stop. **It is infinitely better at doing this and more.**
