From the low level, to the high-level.

On the highest levels the more refined schemes are exceptionally good at taking advantage of the weakness of the average speculator / HODL‚Äôer.

It's rather disgusting if you ask me... Let me take some time to expose one very clever scheme in particular.

When Bitcoin is going up, especially as it was earlier this year without stopping, **the average person was only able to see it going up forever without stopping**. Especially the newcomer.  Many newcomers to BTC are new to investing (speculating) in general.

*The average newcomer is not accustomed to the ""typical"" 40% pull back in BTC and the cyclical bear market.*

**This is used against them by wolves in sheep' clothing.**

BTC Lending Companies prey on unwitting BTC speculators by marketing their loan products as alternatives to hold on to your BTC while accessing some cash at the same time in the form of a loan.  The Lending Business of the leading BTC lending company exploded after Tesla bought based on the interview the Lending CEO gave on financial TV.  

Getting a loan on your BTC instead of selling it (being able to HODL) is marketed to the individual who only sees BTC going up forever and ever, OR, the individual who intends to use the loan to buy more BTC - sort of as a form of margin.

In either instance, they are marketing a ""semi-sophisticated"" product to a ""less than sophisticated"" group of investors.

Unwitting BTC investors and speculators are made aware that the loans are based on the present value of their BTC, but many overlook the inevitable; *if you're taking loans out during rallies, you're going to have to cough up more collateral (BTC), or pay off your loan in full during dips and bear markets.*

People that got loans when BTC was at $58k were screwed.

The local low for BTC is in the $43k range. That's roughly 26% decline. Inasmuch as loans are based on 30% LTV, the average person who did this was required to cough up more collateral or pay the loan off when BTC fell to $43k, in full.

BTC has a habit of ultimately correcting to bull market support levels after significant runs to the upside.  **As it stands now, that number can ultimately be in the $32k to $35k range and I surmise we'll get there in the coming weeks before beginning a surge to $100k by the end of Q3.**

Those folks who used the loans to buy more BTC will have their BTC ""liquidated"" and will walk away with 30 cents on the dollar for every dollar they put at risk in the form of a ""loan.""  Their BTC will have been ""cleverly confiscated"" and they won't be able to enjoy this run up to $100k, even though they bought at high prices.

Those folks who used the loans to buy hookers and c\*ke, will have to pay the loans in full or give the lender more collateral (BTC.)  Clearly, the ""best"" option for them in these cases is to allow their BTC to be confiscated.

&#x200B;

**WHEN IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE BTC LOANS**

If my younger brother came to me and asked me about taking out a loan and using his BTC as collateral to buy more BTC, I'd tell him to only do it when:

1. At or around bull market support levels.
2. When there is fear and blood in the streets.

The 2nd of which is the least risky option.  I myself will be using a BTC loan when BTC corrects to bull market support levels and will allow the lender to take BTC from me when we do have the run up I expect in Q3 to pay off the loan.

**This is akin to buying BTC at a 30% discount.**",2021-03-02
