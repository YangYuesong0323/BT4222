Young and old alike. Rich and poor alike. Smart and dumb alike. Many people still think its just for tech nerds, or financial speculators or the ""rich"".

The problem for these people is they see the price at 60K and think its ""too expensive"". Or they already ""missed out"".

I don't know about everyone else, but I am very concerned that companies like Grayscale control aprox 3% of the BTC supply. If central banks and large countries/ institutions try and buy up all the supply, sure it will moon the price, but it may prevent many ""normal"" people from getting into crypto.

People need to be more educated on what bitcoin can actually become, not just a payment network, or scarce currency, or immutable blockchain, but so much more.

What do you guys think? Will bitcoin just distribute (decentralize) over time, or will big banks and institutions try to corner the market and control the price? Keeping ""normal"" people out?",2021-04-13

I am a long time OTC trader with over 7,500 trades between LocalBitcoins and Paxful. A couple of months ago before meeting a seller for a $50,000 trade (in full accordance with FinCEN regulations), I had them escrow the coins on Paxful for my physical security. When the time came for the seller to release the coins, he received a notice that his rarely used account had been frozen and he could not release or withdraw his coins.

It was strange that his account was frozen after his $50,000 deposit. At the time, I was unaware something was going on at Paxful, so I assumed his account would be unfrozen soon. It’s still frozen two months later. He tells me Paxful just ignores his support requests and has stopped responding. 

I became leery of leaving large amounts of bitcoin on Paxful. Lo and behold, five days ago my account was  frozen immediately after a 0.28 BTC deposit. [I have been told my account is under “compliance review” for “my safety.”](https://i.imgur.com/Jtbv8do.png) When I ask if I can be permitted to withdraw my coins then, I am ignored. When I ask how long the compliance review will take, my question is left unanswered. When I tried to make a post on /r/paxful, [this happened.](https://i.imgur.com/xZQRuJH.png)

43,Bitcoin will never crash.,10,mpnzxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mpnzxb/bitcoin_will_never_crash/,28,2021-04-13 05:36:13," The common thought is that Bitcoin went to the moon after halving, just like it did around 2017. So it will crash eventually, just like it did in 2017. Well... let's try to imagine if that happened. Let's say over the next month, bitcoin drops to 1k and everyone loses their mind. Peter Lynch starts breakdancing on his podcast and tells everyone that he's a genius for predicting it.

I would literally sell everything I own for Bitcoin. I would sleep in a car and live like Ricky from Trailer Park Boys so that I can put my rent money into it, and the only reason I would not sell my car was so that I could pull into a starbucks and use their wifi for crypto trades. I would take a second job, even a third job as a stripper on the weekends, and just continuously buy as many bitcoins as I possibly can.

In fact, I actually seriously hope it crashes. I wake up every morning actually optimistic when it goes into the red, thinking ""This is it! It's gonna crash! Todays the day!"" and it never does, and it never will. Because it's not just me who's hoping for a crash so they can buy it, it's a multitude of institutional investors and billionaires who wouldn't even let the price go to 40k, let alone something absurd like 1k.

Because everyone knows now that it goes to the moon on having cycles, it's now priced into the coin. So it's just going to keep inflating by a certain percentage on average every year. There will obviously be black swans and bear markets like with every asset, not even precious metals like Gold are immune to this, but it's never going crash like it did in 2017 because no one with a functioning cortex would ever sell their coins at a loss.

**TL:DR:** Nobody is ever going to sell their coins at a low price ever again because they know that they can just wait for a halving cycle for it to recover, so you'll never see a 2017 crash again.

Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I own $1000 worth of bitcoin that I bought at 56k, and I'm hoping that it at least goes down to 50k again so I can put another 12 grand into it. But even that seems unlikely.",2021-04-13
