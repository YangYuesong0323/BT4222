16,⚠️⚠️⚠️ Be Aware!! Crypto Scam In progress - Bitmantic.com ⚠️⚠️⚠️,116,mkn9bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mkn9bb/be_aware_crypto_scam_in_progress_bitmanticcom/,48,2021-04-05 23:25:45," I have just encountered a Bitcoin scam on a different level,  
that's not your typical seed theft by a fake wallet or phishing website,  
these guys went beyond what I have expected, let me walk you through:

The name of the site is **""**[**Bitmantic.com**](https://bitmantic.com/)**""**

1. The scam starts with an SMS message I got, stating the following:

*Hi Osnat, as requested, we did an untaxable deposit of about €471,000 into your bitcoin portfolio at Bitmantic.com UserId: 32576475 Pass: bigvon56*

( [https://imgur.com/a2sK4UD](https://imgur.com/a2sK4UD))

2. of course, I try to login out of curiosity to see how the scam works, I use the provided login details and sure it works.  
The page immediately asks to change my current password to a stronger one (at this stage I thought maybe they'll be phish my password and try their luck on some exchanges).  
( [https://imgur.com/yNFkwAE](https://imgur.com/yNFkwAE) )

3. I change the password and it even uses an OTP method of verification, I get an SMS with a code to prove my identity. (there I understood that this wasn't the regular scam we often see)  
( [https://imgur.com/Q6rZNnf](https://imgur.com/Q6rZNnf) )  

4. I open the account and there is indeed the 9.5 BTC balance, I browse through the website just to see how much they actually put into this, and I find that the site is well organized, all the buttons are clickable, there are **About, Privacy, terms of service** pages with actual content.

5. of course, I do what every normal person would do, and try to withdraw the BTC,  
I put my recipient address and I get an error message noting that the first withdrawal amount can't be above 0.00014 BTC (about $7) ""out of security reasons"",  
so sure I try to withdraw the max amount, and I get a confirmation of the site, (here I'm sure that nothing would really happen, and probably I will get a message requesting me to put my seeds to continue the process)

6. ***What happened now blew me away.***  
I get a confirmation on my **Binance** account that I have just deposited funds, and indeed my balance just increased by the $7 mentioned above. (**the scammers sent me the funds!!)**

7. Here is the catch, when I try to withdraw the rest 9.4... BTC that has left, I get a popup saying that I have a withdrawal **Min limit** of 9.5...BTC and basically I have to fund my account in order to continue. (Yea sure..) ( [https://imgur.com/EIXThbR](https://imgur.com/EIXThbR))

Please be **aware** and **share** this with your friends, anyone could fall for this out of pure greed.  
You don't usually see this level of commitment in these scams, these guys went beyond what we know, the website is clean and looks very professional and legit, they send you actual money to lure you in, and I'm sure the success rate is crazy here.  

The scam is based in **Israel** from what I can tell, or at least targets Israelis as the OTP asks for an Israeli number (maybe based on location), I can tell that just by the name ""Osnat"" as it is a common Israeli name and not mine...  
so Thank You for reading and please remember:

Best of all it doesn't require tinkering around with setting up a backend personal server like Electrum, the UI is sleek, and has all the necessary functions for UTXO control. Really happy with Specter and Trezor, and now I have my full node running smoothly. If you were confused with setting up either a full node or multisig, Specter is a good solution. I believe it also works with Rasberrypi/Umbrel if you prefer to run a dedicated hardware node.

GBTC has been referred to as a black hole, as there is no mechanism to redeem shares for BTC. Money goes in, Grayscale buys BTC, and that BTC is never sold.

My first thought upon reading the news was: does it mean that the fund would no longer be a ""black hole""; i.e., would these coins be effectively back in circulation?

I understand that not all ETFs are necesarily redeemable for the asset they track (for example, not all gold ETFs are redeemable for physical gold). That being said, what would happen if investors favoured another ETF and decided to sell all or near all their GBTC shares? Would GBTC *have to* liquidate a lot of bitcoin?",2021-04-06

First of all, \*sorry for my english\* it’s not my native language.

Today is a big day for me. I just sold all of my crypto to pay lawyers and paperwork to get my italian citizenship.

Last year I made two goals (my moons), first one was the prices of everything related to paperwork/lawyers etc and the second was the ticket and life in Italy for at least 3 months while I wait for the citizenship to get a job.

Today I hit my first one.

I was saving money and last year I started saving it on crypto as well and today was the day that I finally got enough to pay all the paperwork/lawyers fees/translations.

I will start saving again from next month on because after the paperwork is done I need to go to Italy to start the process of the citizenship there and of course, crypto is the future!

I’m in Argentina but my great-grandfather came from Italy, so by blood and proving it I have the right to get the citizenship. It’s a long and expensive process but worth it. I don’t know what to expect when I get to Europe but I hope it will be better than here and more opportunities to succeed. 

100 years ago he came looking for a better life, now it’s my turn.

Anyways, just wanted to write this here because reddit was really important to me and I want to thank all of you, even tho I am not present writing stuff all the time I always connect to read your stories and advices, grazie a tutti!

Edit:

Guys, thank you for all your messages!

I didn’t expect so many, i’m really glad you guys liked reading my story and I’ll reply each of you.

Just to clarify:

I’m from Brazil but been living in Argentina for the past 3 years, my family is all in Brazil and nobody went back to Italy still, I can be the first one doing it!

I didn’t sell to BUY the italian citizenship, I sold to pay my lawyer to ask the judge for a new birth certificate because my grandad wasn’t registered when he was born.

The saved crypto I had isn’t for the whole process yet, next month I’ll go back to saving again!

I was able to buy BTC last year and been saving since then with this idea (my first moon).

Thanks so much again!",2021-04-04
