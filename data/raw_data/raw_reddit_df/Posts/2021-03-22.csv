Get a shitty laptop.

Install a fresh copy of ubuntu (erase whole disk when asked during install)

connect to wifi (this is not longer air tight, so keep that in mind)

when it's done, open Terminal

type:

    sudo -H pip3 install bitcoinlib
    

That will install bitcoin library for python3 on your ubuntu machine

disconnect from wifi then type:

>python3

this will take you to python environment and you'll see

\>>>

then type:

    from bitcoinlib.mnemonic import Mnemonic
    from bitcoinlib.encoding import to_hexstring
    from bitcoinlib.wallets import Wallet
    words = Mnemonic().generate()
    words

&#x200B;

that will give you a seed. for example:

    'group grid birth grit wash also when magic that brown erupt swarm'

then type:

    passphrase = 'group grid birth grit wash also when magic that brown erupt swarm'
    w = Wallet.create(""Wallet1"", witness_type='segwit', keys=passphrase, network='bitcoin')
    WalletKeys = (w.get_keys(number_of_keys=10))
    >>> for k in WalletKeys:
    ...    print(k.address)
    ...

    bc1qt46gqxa0peg6n2594jl6vdrfu0c04c3p3870eq

that's it. Now you have 10 addresses from that seed and you have the seed.

Then shoot the laptop with a .45 after writing down your seed.
