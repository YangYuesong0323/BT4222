Some might say you can’t put a price on memories but the truth is for me that I don’t remember 80% of the shit I’ve done while high. 

At the beginning of this pandemic I was a little happy I now had an excuse to just stay at home and smoke my weed but I quickly started to see things differently. I was now wasting away my days and gaining absolutely nothing. 

So around New Years I decided I wanted to take a break and just breath and see if I could do more or even be just as happy without weed. After just a few weeks I understood that all it did was make my mind foggy and take away my time. Recently I became very intrigued by crypto currencies and it boggled my mind how bulletproof Bitcoin seemed to me. I do believe it can be a major asset in the future and if not Bitcoin it self it’ll at least pave the way for the others. 

So I’ve decided I will now take all the money I save from not smoking anymore and put it into Bitcoin mostly and other cryptos and stocks. I will do so by DCA and I’m so excited to see where this goes. I hope this post can maybe point other young adults in the same direction and to be smarter with your money.

Looking as bitcoin neared toward $50k mark earlier today I was increasingly motivated to find my old stash of bitcoins back from 2012 when few people had even heard this was a thing. I recall it was the time where Mt Gox was the only real exchange around and we crowded on IRC channels as well as bitcointalk.org. In 2012 I cashed out 120 bitcoins for a grand total of 1.6k usd - which will remain the worst 'investment' ever for the remainder of my life time.

On another note, today I was scanning all my old wallet backups and found 0.04 bitcoin, worth about 2k USD!!!

EDIT: Found all these old transactions where I was throwing around 2.5btc like it was nothing... lol (I used to gamble on the OG bitcoin dice site called SatoshiDice and made a sweet penny from there as well)

Kinda anxious about this. Disclaimer: I'm kinda dumb. I'm not nearly as tech-savvy as many people reading this might be. But I need help. Apologies in advance if this question comes across silly.

TL;DR: I bought .15 Bitcoin back in 2014 for $100 and today that's worth ~$7,000. I deleted my old wallet accidentally and would like to recover it so I can cash out.

So in 2014, I bought $100 of Bitcoin on my old high school computer. Then I forgot that I did that. I moved several times and brought my computer with me. At some point along the way, I deleted the Bitcoin Core app and all its contents because, well, I'm fucking dumb.

Anyway, I found some old emails from the exchange I used showing that I had bought .15 Bitcoin and transferred it to my wallet. Cool.

I went to go search for my wallet/the Bitcoin Core app and couldn't find it because I deleted it.

**Commence Recovery Process**

I did a data recovery thing and was able to fish out the wallet.dat file from my hard drive. Last modified: 2017. Cool, this has to be the one.

**Now, here's where I'm lost.**

I did some digging online and saw that one way to potentially recover your wallet was to past wallet.dat into Library/ApplicationSupport/Bitcoin/wallets. That's what I did, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/AKkKwOL).

The problem is, I don't know where to go from here.

Bitcoin Core is still syncing with the network, and that may take a couple more days with my shitty internet. [Here's where I've been stuck for a while.](https://imgur.com/fZCg0ei).

When I go to File>Open Wallet, [the only menu option is greyed out.](https://imgur.com/BBvtzNP)

What steps do I need to take from here to recover my wallet? Did I do this correctly so far?

I'm anxious about this because I could really use the funds now. Like, bad. If anyone can walk me through this and help me recover it, I'm open to sending a substantial tip your way.

41,"Governments, financial institutions and banks already know how important Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is and they are all working on plans for investment and adoption. Any public speculation/doubt is because they don't want everyone else to jump in and drive the price up before they have their own chance.",5,lkp7rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lkp7rm/governments_financial_institutions_and_banks/,3,2021-02-16 06:42:27,"All the big banks and financial institutions are currently working on crypto investment plans. But it's the wild west right now, and there are no tried and tested strategies. They are working over time to set up the infrastructure, policies and processes needed to take on a brand new asset class as part of their portfolio, but it still takes ages and comes with enormous risk - not just the risk of a volatile asset, but the risk of implementing strategies with no precedent.

The incentive is to let everyone else know that they are skeptical about Bitcoin **until** they are all in. Banks and investors aren't going to tell you that crypto is important until they are already invested themselves. Up until that point, you will continue hearing about all the ""problems"" with Bitcoin, even if they don't actually believe it.

This isn't a universal truth, and some people are just stupidly against Bitcoin, but every bit of public facing opinion about Bitcoin/cryptocurrency should be taken with a grain of salt. From redditors, to twitter whales, to detractors, to major institutions and government departments - ask yourself what their primary financial incentive is and then read every statement and bit of advice with that in mind.

Not everyone is dishonest, but everyone is trying to make money. Whatever anyone tells you, assume that they have their own financial interests way above your own. That includes me.",2021-02-16
