0,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,428,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,147,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

There’s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

He immediately  introduced me into this crypto space (started with Bitcoin) but couldn’t understand much about investing in it; I was just following what he was saying without much  idea of what I was doing.

https://preview.redd.it/y4c2947qgcq61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed02459c1f8775447322eedbd6f0c5fabd123292

 ***A longtime Bitcoin bull and the founder of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz*** [***spoke about Bitcoin's future.***](https://news.bitcoin.com/boomers-adopt-cryptocurrency-trillion-dollars-bitcoin-novogratz/)

He explained that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, rich baby boomers will be the next generation to come to the bitcoin market.

>*“It could be as much as a trillion dollars comes over the next year from that giant group of wealth."" - declared Novogratz.*

Baby Boomers are those who were born around the end of World War II until the mid-1960s. They were the main beneficiaries of the massive stimulus packages that pumped asset values ​​in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Many of them see bitcoin as an asset that can significantly increase its value, as well as protect their savings from inflation caused by the massive printing of money.

>*""If you’re worried that the U.S. is printing too many dollars … you’re going to shift some of your savings into bitcoin.""*  
*- Michael Novgorats.*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/klscd9fsgcq61.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c24b87de9ece72fb090e6f9b9d06328423bf880

If the CEOs of JMP Securities and Galaxy Digital are not wrong, then in the coming months, huge amounts of money will begin to flow into the bitcoin market, and by the end of the year, their inflow will amount to $2.5 trillion. Now the capitalization of the first cryptocurrency is $1.2 trillion. If you add these two sums, then the capitalization of BTC by the end will reach $3.7 trillion, hence the price of bitcoin will be $177,754.

But since in free circulation, according to Glassnode, at the beginning of the year there were only 4.2 million bitcoins, a reasonable question arises: *what exactly are the listed groups of investors going to buy?* Everything that is available to them on the market today, taking into account all the bitcoins available on exchange wallets and in OTC, is a maximum of 4.2 million BTC.

If we subtract from the total emission of bitcoin, which is 18.6 million today, belonging to the class of illiquid 14.5 million, then the estimated price of bitcoin will be **$711,000 by the end of the year**. And this is without taking into account the money of other buyers, who, of course, are present in the market and their number is growing all the time. It is worth adding an element of common panic buying that can arise against the backdrop of the rapid rise in the price of BTC.

Last year alone, Grayscale Capital and other funds bought about 1 million bitcoins on the market. Under the above-mentioned scenario, no more than 1 million BTC will remain in free circulation by the end of the year.

**Turns out, “To The Moon” is much closer than expected.**

Thanks to Michael Novogratz for the tip.",2021-03-31

In total, I have put in around 3.5 years of my average salary (over the course of 9 years) into Bitcoin. the money did not all come from my salary, as I also invest in stocks and made some gains there which I then put into Bitcoin.

This is a very crude estimate. As a side note, I have also invested in alt coins and (stupidly) tried to trade the market resulting in the loss of some Bitcoin (don't ever do that, trust me I now know). That should have caused me another 2.5 to 3 years worth of my average salary but in the above paragraph I am referring to the Bitcoin i bought and HODL, nothing else.

&#x200B;

**Original Post:**

I believe this should be true for many people, especially if they started in 2017 (even better if started in 2016).

Essentially, Bitcoin has earned me double the money within less than half the time, hence it is 4x easier to earn with Bitcoin than going to work.

Not to mention Bitcoin doesn't need me to actually physically go to work and do work and endure office politics  9-6 every weekday. Bitcoin just needs you to buy it, and sit there, and it will earn for you.

Hence Biotcin is at least 6x better than going to work in terms of earning. (Yes some people would go to work for ""aspiration"" and ""self fulfillment"" and blah blah blah but let's not count these people ok?)

“ Today, the Brew unveiled a brand new design for our Markets section with some pretty big changes. So before we get into the day's business news, we wanted to provide a little insight into why we made the switch.

From a graphics POV, we got rid of some unnecessary white space so that, with just a quick glance, you can tell if indicators moved up or down.

You also probably noticed that we removed oil and gold. In their place, we added 1) bitcoin and 2) a ""flex"" spot, which will allow us to showcase any security—whether it's a tech stock, oil, or dogecoin—that made an interesting move the previous day. Today we picked JPMorgan stock because of the turmoil around the banking sector.”

Is this sufficient or is it wiser to store digital asset keys on 2 wallets?  I’ve been reading that there is a risk trade off between security and complexity.  I’m not yet ready for multi-signature  (one day maybe). 

Thanks.",2021-03-31
47,Why you won't need to sell your Bitcoin,99,mgi4cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mgi4cn/why_you_wont_need_to_sell_your_bitcoin/,96,2021-03-30 23:07:36,"My moon was to sell my Bitcoin around 2024, 2025, when the next halving happens. My dream is to leave my country and live in a developed country, and I'll need money for that.

But I was thinking, if you have an asset as a store of value, like real state, you never need to sell it, you use as a collateral to borrow money.

BlockFi and Celsius demonstrated that it's possible to borrow money with Bitcoin and you'll never need to sell. While I still don't trust them with my Bitcoin for now (the track record is too short), four/five years from now, I believe that borrowing money with Bitcoin will be more developed and safer and will be a better option than selling! #HODL

Edit: another advantage that I forgot to mention, if you sell you need to pay tax gains, if you borrow you won't.

It's that meme of Matrix: ""are you telling me that when Bitcoin gets to 1 million I can sell it?""
""No Neo, when it gets to 1 million, you won't have to.""",2021-03-30

A man in Cali that had hit Bitcoin on an old computer. I believe 400 million worth. He forgot to save the Bitcoin info, and didn’t know to save in vault or wallet when he got rid of his old computer. He’s offering up half the money, if someone can retrieve his old computer from a dump sight. It got me thinking, I wonder how many people disposed of computers with Bitcoin, before they knew the potential!  Gives “mining for Bitcoin” an entirely different meaning!",2021-03-31
