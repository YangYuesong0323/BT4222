0,WARNING! Stay away from Blockchain.com wallet!,792,mcd99v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mcd99v/warning_stay_away_from_blockchaincom_wallet/,272,2021-03-25 02:43:38,"There have been numerous thefts on Blockchain.com (previously Blockchain.info) wallet. Hundreds or even thousands of customers have lost millions worth of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

The most recent reason for these thefts is 2FA malfunction. Most victims have stated that right before the theft, either 2FA email has been changed or 2FA completely disabled, after which all funds have been moved out.

[https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds](https://honestproscons.com/blockchain-com-is-losing-customers-funds)

There’s a known 2FA security flaw on Blockchain.com that allows a hacker to disable 2FA without needing to authenticate with 2FA first. This allows the hacker to login to the wallet with just Wallet ID and password.

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2\_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91\_0\_21](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B7Edd-fj3wSegL2_JMwKBglPzk3pBG9DUVLuz3HPP-w/edit#slide=id.g848d967a91_0_21)

Even though Blockchain.com has been aware of this flaw since 2019, it still has not been fixed. This flaw is likely the reason for multiple hacks, though there may be other security flaws in the Blockchain.com wallet. The involvement of Blockchain.com staff or a data leak cannot be ruled out either.

As of now, Blockchain.com is unwilling to accept responsibility or admit that their system has any security flaws. Instead, Blockchain.com is threatening people who have exposed these flaws with legal actions. Here's the example of such a letter and further correspondence with their lawyers:

[https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff](https://blockchaindotcomsucks.com/legal-stuff)

Blockchain.com has also been unable to provide any reasonable support to its customers and has offered absolutely no aid to the victims of the theft. As a result of this, on TrustPilot, 60% of reviews are negative 1-star reviews.

[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com?stars=1)

We strongly advise everyone to stop using Blockchain.com wallet and their other services due to the extremely low security they provide and the high risk of theft on their platform.

2,Sold my crypto today to pay for my italian citizenship,3673,mjwhag,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjwhag/sold_my_crypto_today_to_pay_for_my_italian/,504,2021-04-04 21:42:32,"Hello guys!

First of all, \*sorry for my english\* it’s not my native language.

Today is a big day for me. I just sold all of my crypto to pay lawyers and paperwork to get my italian citizenship.

Last year I made two goals (my moons), first one was the prices of everything related to paperwork/lawyers etc and the second was the ticket and life in Italy for at least 3 months while I wait for the citizenship to get a job.

Today I hit my first one.

I was saving money and last year I started saving it on crypto as well and today was the day that I finally got enough to pay all the paperwork/lawyers fees/translations.

I will start saving again from next month on because after the paperwork is done I need to go to Italy to start the process of the citizenship there and of course, crypto is the future!

I’m in Argentina but my great-grandfather came from Italy, so by blood and proving it I have the right to get the citizenship. It’s a long and expensive process but worth it. I don’t know what to expect when I get to Europe but I hope it will be better than here and more opportunities to succeed. 

100 years ago he came looking for a better life, now it’s my turn.

Anyways, just wanted to write this here because reddit was really important to me and I want to thank all of you, even tho I am not present writing stuff all the time I always connect to read your stories and advices, grazie a tutti!

Edit:

Guys, thank you for all your messages!

I didn’t expect so many, i’m really glad you guys liked reading my story and I’ll reply each of you.

Just to clarify:

I’m from Brazil but been living in Argentina for the past 3 years, my family is all in Brazil and nobody went back to Italy still, I can be the first one doing it!

I didn’t sell to BUY the italian citizenship, I sold to pay my lawyer to ask the judge for a new birth certificate because my grandad wasn’t registered when he was born.

The saved crypto I had isn’t for the whole process yet, next month I’ll go back to saving again!

I was able to buy BTC last year and been saving since then with this idea (my first moon).

Thanks so much again!",2021-04-04

As she tells me this, I think this is a horrible plan. I launch conversation into bitcoin and how the US dollar is losing value. I explain this not a get rich quick scheme, and how this a 4-8 year hold. The end result is she opens her app and maxs out her daily limit. 

I am praying BTC will do what we think it will. I know all the potential is here and expanding. Been crypto since early 2018. Waiting around is the hard part.

I am fortunate to have a decent paying job that will allow me to service the debt on the blockfi/ btc loan repayment comfortably + the additional $250 monthly from the income property.

I love bitcoin but I feel it’s biggest downside is it is not an income producing asset, hence the thought of leveraging to buy assets that will pay living expenses at a future date of 10-15 years out.

I understand why subtle differences in input messages create vastly different digests, that the output lengths of all SHA-256 hashes are fixed, and that in this example I'm inputting strings - not numbers.

I'm sure there are tax implications that I will have to deal with, but I don't know what they are... Also where do you advertise a house for Bitcoins? How does the process work? I would do it with a title company , but they would want to be paid in US currency, so I'm not sure how I would structure the deal.... The only houses I've seen for sale are the McMansions and that, just isn't what I'm offering. This is just a regular house near supermarkets and fast-food places.",2021-04-05
43,Asian Girl Tinder scam,43,mjuz20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjuz20/asian_girl_tinder_scam/,56,2021-04-04 20:03:47,"I recently got two of these scam matches in just one day in UK. I know it's been going on for a while and mentioned before but it seems more rampant than ever these days, hence this post. The pattern:

* Pretty Asian girl in her late 20s, early 30s
* She says she's currently looking for friends, not love or ONS => you won't flirt too much but talk about all kinds of things
* She in/near your city but is currently visiting family for a few weeks/months => you can't meet her in person
* She quickly wants to move on to Whatsapp
* I matched bots before but here it appeared to be 'real' humans behind the messages

For over a week, we've been talking normal things, food, hobbies, what books you like reading. She sent me pics of her meals and selfies, all looked legit. She kept asking ""what are you doing today"" every day, once I mentioned Bitcoin and she boasted she made 21 BTC. She offered to help me make some quick money, finally she sent me some images/download links which I obviously didn't click.

I might have been bit naive but I'm sure I'm not the only one, so stay safe guys :D",2021-04-04
44,Why have the average # of reachable full nodes not gone up over time?,9,mk4eal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mk4eal/why_have_the_average_of_reachable_full_nodes_not/,8,2021-04-05 04:40:47,"[https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=730](https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=730)

According to this, the average number of full nodes has stayed quite steady around 10k for the last 2 years. I would have expected the number of full nodes to steadily increase with time.

On a side note, I spun up my first full node today!",2021-04-05

What is that number.

**update** there's been a few good answers but many more hostile reactions.  yes I'm already aware it  decentralized, that does bring some network communication issues at high enough scales. 

This is a thought experiment on how large the number of nodes would be before it would be a problem. Don't insist so much that's irrelevant",2021-04-04

48,UK tax question,5,mk5nue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mk5nue/uk_tax_question/,10,2021-04-05 05:46:44,I have sold and reinvested a lot of bitcoin and other crypto this year and have definitely gone over the £12300 tax free  profit allowance.  I am an idiot who hasn't kept any record of my transactions this year bar the order history on CEXs.  What's the best way to go about working out how much tax I owe?  This is not my strong suit at all and I have never paid taxes before.  Is it best to get a tax accountant to look at this or is it best to use some tax calculator software (I know there are a few about).  If so what tax accountants/ calculators are good in the UK?  I am willing to pay for whatever service I use.  Any help and advice is appreciated :),2021-04-05

When I explain the technology to people in person, they love it and most of them buy into the idea and potential behind blockchains! 

But I find it hard to gain traction for this online because educational content is not as sexy or click baity as 
- X to the moon
- FUD or
- FOMO content

Would love to hear your suggestions on how to make blockchain tech education more sexy without using  deceiving titles or exploiting people's fears?
