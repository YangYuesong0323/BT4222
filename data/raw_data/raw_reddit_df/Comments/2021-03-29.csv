The reason for this is that since the local police in the country of the victims is not very eager to investigate this case, the best solution is to file a claim against BLOCKCHAIN LUXEMBOURG S.A R.L.

This will obviously cost lot of money, most likely way over 10k$ if we to go to court and fight there.

Since there's lot of victims the best way to do this, is to combine our resources, file a claim together and share the expenses.

How many of you would be willing to do this? And put few hundred bucks to the cause?

We also need a trustworthy person or persons to handle the communication with the lawyer and possibly attend the court. Someone who is living in or near Luxembourg would be a perfect match.

So, like… you never asked what happened to it? 

She may just be sitting on it or forgot about it.

My grandparents did something similar and I always knew I had a Royal Bank of Canada bank account from when I was a kid. 

They’d always put my bday money, Christmas money and Easter money into it. Apparently they were putting money into it until 2018 when they passed.

I didn’t even think to ask about it because I was too busy living and working all over the world. And they were too busy with, uh… terminal cancer…

But I called RBC and after some digging and paperwork - yup, there was a perfectly tidy sum of money waiting for me. 

I’m actually moving from NYC up to Canada on that money, the last gift of my grandparents! I miss them.
