Are we looking at the same chart? The previous all-time-high of the last bull run was $1100. We broke it in early 2017, and then peaked at the end of the year with a new all-time-high of $19,800, 20x the previous all-time-high. We broke *that* all-time-high **two months ago**, and have gone up... 3x so far.

What movements do you think have already been made?

You are making an argument that the price will fall. You don't know that. So someone following your advice may choose to sit out while they watch the price climb to $78,000. Now, you could be right, and the price could fall to $34,000. Then you'd be a hero. The point is, you have no good reason to make the argument that 'this dip isn't over'. Just as *I* have no good reason to tell someone that we're going to recover quickly.

In the short-term, NO ONE KNOWS.

In the long-term, we have a clear upward trend. So, of the two recommendations that could be made; (buy now, don't buy now). One is *at least* likely to result in a positive return in the long run. So if you're going to dispense advice on what other people should do, please recognize that the best advice for anyone at any time, is to ignore the charts, ignore the price, and buy as much as you can, whenever you can.",t3_lqh42k,2021-02-23 22:25:01,2021-02-23

Have you looked into the carbon footprint of banks? Bitcoin is still a small percentage of the energy consumption compared to the banking infrastructure. You would be mind-blown to learn just the carbon footprint of just running air conditioners in every single bank around the world, let alone calculating the footprint of every single money truck driving around every day.

If you look at the big picture you'll realize that Bitcoin mining is actually incredibly efficient compared to our modern banking infrastructure. That may not always be the case but that is the case now. Hopefully renewable energy will continue to thrive in the Bitcoin ecosystem and it will stay that way. People who feel this way can't wrap their head around the utility of Bitcoin and therefore cannot assign value to any of the processes. 

According to the most recent research by coinshares 78% of that is renewable energy. That number is likely going to increase as time goes on.

But it is not about the positives with blockchain technology for them, they only see their decline in influence and power due to it, so of course it must be bad.

That is not correct. The Fed is going to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future. They have no exit strategy for low interest rates without bursting the housing bubble and crashing the stock market subsequently wiping out most peoples retirement. I wouldn't be surprised if I'll be able to refi again next year at an even lower rate.
