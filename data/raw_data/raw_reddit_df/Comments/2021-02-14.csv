18,gnbx8bv,t3_krqrmf,I purchased Bitcoin on coinbase but was only able to transfer half of it to coinbase wallet because it says the rest isn’t available ... is there a reason why? Will it eventually be able to transfer?,t3_krqrmf,2021-02-14 09:28:39,2021-02-14

I bought bitcoin last year on coin base and have kept them in there since. I’ve read up on wallets and how to store the coins, but I still don’t understand the need in having a wallet If the coins are on coin base. What is the benefit / necessity in having a wallet and storing my bitcoins? Is it a symbolic move? Are the coins safe / protected on coin base?

118,gn8yqzp,t1_gmhpfxl,"Anyone you send to can explore the blockchain and find out where the money came from. I'm in a different crypto, but this is an example from my personal life. My dad sent me a little coin he'd been holding for me, because I wanted it at the price it was then, but it was before I was set up on any exchanges or wallets. I said, hey dad, can you buy an extra $200 worth on your next purchase, I'll give you the cash, then you send me the coin after I'm all set up? So months later I am finally ready to buy a larger amount, I get all set up and I also ask my dad to also send me what he'd held for me.  He did not want to tell me how much money he'd invested, but after he sent the money, I could go to a ledger explorer, look up my own wallet, then see which wallet that had come from, and look it up and find out how much he has (at least in that wallet, he could have others). So now I know when the price moons how rich he will be. Even wallets that don't have transactions (other than from the exchange) can be found by exploring the blockchain, but just seeing it interacted with an exchange doesn't tell you anything about the person. So I think this is more about privacy in someone knowing what you have in there rather than being able to actually get at that money. But if you have a lot, and someone connects it to you, it could make you a target for scams that use good old fashioned social engineering, like phishing and the like.",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-14 01:26:49,2021-02-14

They don't do it out of ill intend, but subconsciously people feel threatened once a person they know starts having high goals or plans in life because they're afraid of losing you once you change too much. This all happens inside their head without knowing, so just know that your mom has best intentions even if she acts like a bitch.

1888,gnejc07,t3_ljmmrr,"You're going to be hearing a lot of people say that you shouldn't tell people about investments because they will be negative and ""they don't understand"".  


The truth is, you're probably not very experienced and you underestimate established institutions. You need to be able to understand both sides. There's a lot of talk in the cryptocommunity about ""going to the mooooon"" and to HODL. Some of these people know what they're getting themselves into, but a large share of people act in an almost sect-like behavior.

&#x200B;

My advice to you is: don't invest more than you can afford to lose. This comes from someone who did that to some degree. It's okay to make mistakes, but please don't put all of your eggs in one basket. It \*is\* difficult to get out in time. I don't know your parents, but I think it might be good to talk about this stuff with them. They're just trying to help you. Not talking to them because they have a differing opinion is NOT rational. You can still choose to invest in crypto while still listening to what they have to say.  


With that said, I believe in cryptocurrency long-term. However, there are still some things that need to change. Transaction prices are currently waaaay to high for Bitcoin to ever become usable. I also don't believe that Bitcoin is such a good cryptocurrency. Proof-of-work requiring electric usage in the magnitude of Ireland is not good. Proof-of-stake is better in that regard. Smart contracts are also very interesting and something that Bitcoin lacks. With that in mind, I'm sure that Bitcoin will still rise in value, but I believe some other cryptocurrencies are better. Say what you want about memecoins, but do you think rational people would actually like to use a product that is worse than alternatives such as Ethereum? You wouldn't buy a cool bicycle that is a meme and use it to get places simply because ""it's a meme"".",t3_ljmmrr,2021-02-14 22:00:13,2021-02-14

2837,gnbswfb,t3_lj5ob8,"I don’t know, I mean, isn’t the entire point of BTC to be a currency?

Then the question becomes, can something that fluctuates in value in the range of +-50% from month to month even be considered a viable currency? Even *close*? At all? Like, this is some 1930’s Germany level stuff, except it’s pretty much been happening since BTC’s inception. There never was a normal. We simply are here.

And I mean, Tesla, the electric car / green energy company, investing $1.5 billion in a currency that uses as much energy as Switzerland... definitely an oxymoron. They’re trying to make money, they don’t care about the legitimacy of BTC.

I don’t own BTC and I guess I would be considered an outsider in this subreddit. I guess my question for everyone here is what is the end goal? It would seem that BTC skyrocketing once every few years almost nearly completely defeats the purpose of BTC, despite the fact that these events become the driving interest *behind* BTC.

It will be interesting to see if BTC is still around in 50 or so years and, if it does, what it looks like.",t3_lj5ob8,2021-02-14 09:01:51,2021-02-14

3289,gndgry4,t1_gndg8vb,"In order to know which transactions have happened on the network, a wallet needs to have a source for this knowledge. A full node is such a source. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions.  

A full node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

> One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
>  
>    
> If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
>  
> * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
> 
> * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
> 
> * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
> 
> * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
> 
> ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
>  
> If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
> 
> SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
>  
> Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
>  
> So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
>  
> Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
>  
> Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lnd/  

A full node does *not* help the network. It is helping *you*, the node maintainer/user. When you are using your own full node, you don't have to rely on third party servers to monitor your balance, to broadcast your transactions, to tell you which chain is the correct one. By using third party servers, you also leak sensitive privacy details to them (your IP, your transactions etc). So by utilizing your own node, you become a sovereign, peer2peer user of the network, thereby indirectly strengthening it. By simply spinning up a node doesn't do much in itself.",t3_ljho45,2021-02-14 15:49:54,2021-02-14

There are certain attacks that can happen if you trust someone else's node that alter your view of the utxo, which is important eg if your and exchange for instance or accepting high value payments.

I doubt Europe allows people to go about their daily lives, and even if the US doesn't do lockdowns, they will do masks non stop. Multiple business will need to shut down. 

This is where the money printing goes exponential. This is why I think many are buying bitcoin. Debt right now is 28 trillion-and by year end, easily 31 trillion.

Quarantined countries like New Zealand (where tourism is 15-20% GDP) are completely fucked.

Money printing combined with low interest rates and work from home routines has many people pulling cash out of their houses, not being able to afford significantly better houses, but knowing they can't keep cash that will inflate 10%/year. There's no hope for commercial or low income real estate, no point in bonds that pay significantly less than inflation, and never been a worse time for investing in small business. So everyone's a day trader now. The stock market is the only thing that paid off in 2020, and it is bloated like nothing in recent history.

Umm, that's already been confirmed to have happened.  As in, by sequencing the viruses from someone who got infected twice, months apart.  And as in by reading the news stories about people who have been vaccinated weeks earlier (i.e., they're well past the window period where immunity still wouldn't have been developed in a typical patient) and still got infected.

3865,gndehqw,t3_ljf286,"IMO, it’s impossible to “price in” BTC.

BTC is just a digital bearer asset (digital gold, you hold it, you own it). The value behind it depends on how you view it.

For example, if you view it as gold, then one way to value it is the market cap of gold/ quantity of BTC (either in circulation or total that will ever be mined, 21m)

Everyone will have their own opinion, but that’s what makes BTC so beautiful, it’s free from manipulation. The ONLY thing that drives price is supply and demand, and with a forced decrease in supply every 4 years, causing forced appreciation until the year 2140 when the last coins mined.

The point I’m trying to make (might just be rambling but idc), is it’s impossible to “price in” BTC until all the coins been mined, until then we will have force appreciation of each coin, and that every halving puts a new floor which seems to always be hire than the previous halvings high.

3871,gnemr4r,t1_gnci5e8,"[Stock-to-Flow](https://digitalik.net/btc/) makes it really clear what's going on: Each time a Halvening changes the true value of Bitcoin, the market price acts like a spring that has been suddenly released.

There is upward pressure towards the true value, but momentum carries it too far. It swings above the true value, causing pressure to reverse. However, it takes a while for this pressure to slow down the momentum enough to reverse the trend and cause it to start falling. From there, it keeps oscillating around the true value, boing, boing, boing, until it eventually settles on it.

That doesn't sound like a big deal, but the amplitude of these oscillations is incredible. Stock-to-Flow predicts the true value instantly increases 10x with every Halvening, so the amplitude is **on the order of 10x** as well. That is why the 2016 cycle saw the price swing from $1k to $20k before eventually settling on the true value of $10k a few years later. That is why I think this cycle will go from $10k to $200k before eventually settling on $100k, assuming Stock-to-Flow is correct about the true value being $100k.

Predictable events definitely aren't priced in. The market does react to changes in value, but it is like a force, or pressure, pushing it in the right direction.

In other words, the market is **eventually consistent**, not omniscient.

Bitcoin shows how big and lumbering the market actually is: It takes **2\~4 years** after-the-fact to correctly price in a Halvening.",t3_ljf286,2021-02-14 22:14:10,2021-02-14

3911,gndfqrl,t1_gnca0ey,"And it's always been like that. 🤷‍♂️ 

People said the halving was already priced in in 2016 as well, yet shortly afterwards it started surging from around $500 to almost $20,000 in 2017. 40x, or almost 20x of previous ATH.

2012: ~$10 to around $200 in early/mid 2013 (before it rallyed to $1,200, though that extra surge was more due to the MtGOX fiasco).",t3_ljf286,2021-02-14 15:40:54,2021-02-14
