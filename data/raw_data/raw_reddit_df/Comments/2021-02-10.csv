239,gmt98k7,t3_lgo5rm,"I made a post about this https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lgt4yb/us_tech_companies_who_may_disclose_bitcoin

I scoured through the top US tech companies, who are the most likely to be the first institutional investors of Bitcoin, to find when their next 10K is likely to be submitted to the SEC. I also had a quick look at some other big players.

In their 10K they are required to disclose any purchase of Bitcoin by their treasury. Other companies may choose to do so, but they are not required to.

In February we can expect these Tech Companies to disclose their 10K to the SEC

 ‚Ä¢ FIS

 ‚Ä¢ Fiserv

 ‚Ä¢ Texas Instruments

 ‚Ä¢ IBM

 ‚Ä¢ NVIDIA

 ‚Ä¢ Salesforce (Maybe early March)

 ‚Ä¢ Verizon

 ‚Ä¢ AT & T

 ‚Ä¢ Mastercard

Outside of the tech industry, these major players are also due to file their 10K

 ‚Ä¢ Walmart (Maybe March)

 ‚Ä¢ ExxonMobil 

 ‚Ä¢ CVS

 ‚Ä¢ Cigna

 ‚Ä¢ Chevron

 ‚Ä¢ GM

 ‚Ä¢ Johnson & Johnson

 ‚Ä¢ Home Depot (Maybe March)

 ‚Ä¢ Coca Cola

So we will have an excellent idea where we are placed in receiving support from Institutional Investment by the end of February.

Large players such as Oracle and Microsoft are not due to file their 10K until as late as August but probably July.

Apple is not required to disclose purchases until as late as November.",t3_lgo5rm,2021-02-10 21:11:55,2021-02-10

Collateral is different from selling in most places, which is why it usually doesn't incur capital gains issues.

In practice, it comes down to the agreement which is likely to be non standard in this case so you should look it over in detail below signing up, especially if you are in a different jurisdiction from them.

A crypto wallet is not the same. It doesn't *hold* cash (coins) like an account or a regular wallet. Your crypto wallet is actually a set of keys. 

There is a private key and a public key. Imagine your private key is your back pocket. Only *you* can access your back pocket because your wearing the pants.

Your public key is your hands, more or less, where people can hand you money and you can put it in. There is no danger here because people can only give you cash with your hands (public key).

However, you must keep your back pocket safe (private keys) because this is how you can *take out* your cash.

Elon is a moron.

I respect his innovative capacity but that's it

His level of professionalism is repulsive and not welcomed, especially when we're trying to push bitcoin to be more mainstream and respected. Sure you can have fun with creating a S3XY line of cars, creating a sci-fi like cybertruck, but that's as far as your jokes/memes should go when you hold this much influence

Elon did NOT push this trend; he is merely a follower. Michael Saylor is the true champion for public and private companies investing in bitcoin.

You are thinking of nydig as a exchange when it is actually a fund. I won't deny that clients can exit their position in the fund but that would defeat the purpose of this type of financial vehicle.

Institutions will allocate resources into funds for long-term exposure. It's part of a investment basket. This is not the correct financial vehicle for the type of market activity you are talking about. I'm sure that there are many institutions playing the market short-term (and currently getting rekt), but not at nydig. I think the most truthful thing in your comment is that it could be that some clients have targeted entry points that may be lower than what this will go to, and therefore not all capital is guaranteed to purchase.

Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect: 
'You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward‚Äîreversing cause and effect. You read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate.

Answer to Scalability:

Why would you scale beyond the network's needs? When credit cards started, when Dining Club first introduced a credit system, the card was locally tracked, and was paper. We didn't even have digital scaling at the time the credit card system was developed. The reason it wan't necessary is because credit cards were not a consumer tool that was widespread until the 90s. They didn't even need to figure out the millions of transactions a second problem until 50+ years after their invention.

&#x200B;

Energy scaling:

Bitcoin mining happens where Bitcoin mining is profitable. If you want to decrease the amount of energy put into the Bitcoin network, then reduce the global subsidies for energy.

Dogecoin:

It's a joke. Millenials have thought they discovered a way to make money by building Ponzi schemes using decentralized purchasing and stocks. Now they're doing it with Doge coin. They are playing a stupid game of chicken. Most of them will lose their money.

Bitcoin would need to increase by 1000x to establish itself at 4 cents per sat, or 250x per cent.

If the price doubles, the inflation rate essentially doubles.

That's why although Bitcoin's inflation rate is a low 6.25/8.5-10minutes, once you multiply that by the price it becomes a difficult to maintain price even at that inflation rate.

When bitcoin was mined at 50/block and worth 1$ * 50 coins * 6 * 24 * 365 = inflating by $219,000 per year

Now 6.25 * $40000 * 6 * 24 * 365 = inflating by $13.4b per year that needs to be purchased per year to maintain a $40000 price.

I'm under the impression that the price of fiat doesn't affect Doge's inflation rate, since Doge's inflation comes from the 5 billion new coins created a year.  The price of fiat doesn't affect how many coins are mined.

The sad part is that most likely none of those charities held Bitcoin in the long run. Their goal is to spend anyways, which is good (and does good), but I doubt they had to spend it all in fiat quickly and nonetheless chances are they converted it to fiat on the spot, and missed out on a lot of value increase to do even more good.

Charities should be concerned by inflation decimating their reserves, even more than for profit companies, they should hold them in sound money.

But if it‚Äôs supposed to be an actual currency, then my understanding is that you don‚Äôt want massive inflation with any currency, but you definitely don‚Äôt want deflation.  The goal is mild inflation constantly.  The reason for this is to spur investment in other real world parts of the economy, businesses, take risks, etc.  Otherwise, it would be more profitable to hold the currency (Bitcoin) than to actually invest it in economic pursuits, and you get economic recession.  I believe that this happened in Japan in the 90s-/2000 with their ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô.  If that were the case, then would mass adoption of Bitcoin as a true common currency lead to it causing economic catastrophe, which would of course lead to it being banned and subsequently devalued.

I would expect that this would occur after massive adoption, but still, would occur?  Which to me makes it more of a speculative asset or inflationary hedge.  Am I missing something?",t3_lg7bqv,2021-02-10 02:58:25,2021-02-10

3. Official inflation figures ommit increases in real estate, energy, healthcare, education fees; they are highly manipulated by bankers to the detriment of people that have salaries/pensions pegged to the nominal inflation rate . IMHO, mild inflation being good is a myth propagated by central bankers and finance ministers. Saying that mild inflation occurs in growing economies and is healthy, essentially obscures the fact that your money loses value over time. You tell me if you want your 100 dollars to have 90 dollars of purchasing value after 4 years. Also, monetary inflation is more in the realms of 5% on a normal year to 25% (2020), i.e. not at all mild. Effectively that meant that the FED balance sheet went up from 20 trillion in 2019 to 25 trillion in 2020. Your pizza was 20 trillion pieces - now it is 25 trillion pieces. So each rightful owner of one of those pieces of pizza in 2019 has to share it with a few more newcomers. Not good. Esp if those 5 trillion went to bankers and other wealthy people. Thats why the stockmarket went up on during 2020 where most companies had shitty results

I agree with the other critics that nothing has intrinsic value; even characteristics like the conductivity of gold are not intrinsic since they depend on conductivity in turn being intrinsically valued (which it is not, as prior to the harnessing of electricity no one cared that it was conductive).

3780,gmtqybx,t3_lgp8ke,"12, 16, 20, 24. These are the years of the halvening. So far the spikes have occurred on the latter half of the next year. 13, 17, respectively. Then BTC fell to about one-fifth of the high.


If this pattern continues then we could see up to 400,000$ per btc by the end of the year and then a fall to 80,000$ per btc in 2022.

Some things that may complicate this is large investments by corporations may cause the spike early. Maybe they see the pattern too.

There is also a major market correction predicted later this year. Cathy Woods called it a ""doozey"".  This could cause a divestment of btc for folks covering margin or bargain hunting. It could trigger the dip early or cause a false dip that rebounds until the real dip next year.

Finally, if the dollar collapses then all models are out the window because people will pour their paper money into crypto as a hedge against inflation and that will drive the price up more than anyone can predict.

So then, I think buying in at 47k is okay if it spikes the same 20x as twice before. 47k is less that the one-fifth drop we've seen twice before.",t3_lgp8ke,2021-02-10 23:39:18,2021-02-10

I'm sure the community has some real hardcore Hodlers but that kind of fluctuation suggests that there's also a healthy amount of speculators.

While such volatile swings may be daunting for the newbie joining the hype train, wouldn't it be also true to say newbies could take advantage of this fluctuation? If they can properly time it that is. If what you say is correct that a spike is to follow roughly a year after a halvening then we are due for a spike and then a dip at (roughly?) six months after the new ATH which would bring the price back down to somewhere near the pre-spike price?

3789,gmtexu7,t1_gmst3rq,"That might be the safest long-term play. 

If the drop you predict does occur, that lends strength to the idea that a new spike is coming in the future. You might miss out on short-term profits, but you gain the ability to feel confident when you do buy.

If something unpredictable happens, then your mental model was incorrect, so the play was too risky. You don't know if it'll go up or down. So maybe it is good you didn't buy.

That being said, Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable tendency for each new spike to make the last one look like a tiny blip. Decades from now, you might not even be able to tell the difference between buying on a spike or a dip. Who knows.",t3_lgp8ke,2021-02-10 22:06:09,2021-02-10

Why? 2017/18 dip was mass FOMO from paper hands who didn't understand what they had bought.  In 2021 we have way more diamond hands.  Between the long-term investors and institutions buying, and the Hodlers who now have been through the cycle, I just don't believe we're going to get that same supply surplus at higher prices, that we had in early 2018.",t3_lgp8ke,2021-02-10 23:08:41,2021-02-10

3793,gmtaj1q,t1_gmt33ml,"The Halvening is still recent, and the market is still figuring out the new price. That makes now one of the riskiest and most uncertain times to speculate. I personally believe this spike has only begun, and it's early enough that I suspect the valley we see on the other side of the **giant drop** may be higher than today's price. But I don't know‚Äîthat's why it is risky.

The [Stock-to-Flow model](https://digitalik.net/btc/) (my favorite) predicts a new normal of $100k this cycle. However, that is by no means assured. This model was invented only 6 months ago, and this Halvening marks its first true test. (So far it is passing.)

That being said, you are asking a Bitcoin believer whether or not to invest in Bitcoin. Of course I am bullish. I am of the opinion that getting in during a spike is only dangerous if you sell during the **drop**. If your plan is to hold long-term, an 80% contraction just adds 4 years to how long you have to wait to get a return. That's not great, but it's not the end of the world.

At the end of the day, you have to make your own decision.",t3_lgp8ke,2021-02-10 21:25:01,2021-02-10

We don't know what the exact magnitude of the spike and **giant drop** will be, but I suspect we will hit a new normal of $100k before the next Halvening. Before then, we can expect the value to oscillate above and below that value, before settling.

That is, if the model is correct. So far it is spot-on. It predicted the start of this spike perfectly. I am excited to see how the next four years play out.",t3_lgp8ke,2021-02-10 21:42:44,2021-02-10

3800,gmtk1g6,t1_gmtexu7,"I'm certain bitcoin will reach 6 figures at some point, maybe even 5 to 10 years from now, but with it's incredible long term growth and very small relative supply I think it's a guaranteed outcome with enough time. That alone would make purchasing now a very decent deal but the knowledge I've gained from the charts, especially after a huge spike like this tell me to hold till the price drops a bit, allowing me to get more for the same price and ensure better future gains. I've messed up by cashing in too soon for quick profits and made less than I could have so now I've resolved to play the long game. With the ATH it's just too risky for me to get in right now but as you say anything can happen the price may never dip much. I will buy up as much as I can in the years till the next halvening and wait till the next insane spike happens to cash in around 30-40% to make funds for the next dip and repeat that. I think we'll see the biggest spike in the months after the last coin has been mined. Who knows, news like that could drive the price up to even half a mil.

Watch those in order and understand it all, research and learn the difference between a custodial wallet and a personal wallet. Learn the difference between a centralized service like Cashapp and a decentralized exchange like Bisq.

[https://coindoo.com/decentralized-vs-centralized-exchanges-whats-the-difference/](https://coindoo.com/decentralized-vs-centralized-exchanges-whats-the-difference/)

After that, research how to create your own personal wallet securely. Transfer your coins into your own wallet. Hold for years and make large gains for your family. I recommend learning about Electrum wallet:
