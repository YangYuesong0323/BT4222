&#x200B;

I just purchased my first coins(?) of around $160. Didn't make much but watching the price hit 50K and watching the hype around it, I'm ready to jump in.

I'm going to be doing my own research but I had a question about risk.

\- Would keeping my BTC in Coinbase App (Android) be safe for now? I have a small amount of BTC ($160) and 30$ in ETH. I've been browsing this forum and found out about different ways to keep your crypto safe. I plan on getting a hard wallet eventually (are there safer ways to keep crypto?) but for now, is it safe to keep in Coinbase App alone? I figure if a hacker can get into my coinbase, they wouldnt get much for the effort anyway.",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-17 22:40:58,2021-02-17

There is only a ban on derivative products, **not** on bitcoin buying/selling/holding itself.   

>  Coinbase now say I cannot buy any.  

This shouldn't be in relation to that law, see above. Most likely it is because of something else (did they close/restrict your account for some reason)? If this was the case (it isn't), you wouldn't be able to buy bitcoin anywhere else in the UK.  

You can also see other exchanges with GBP/BTC trading like Bitstamp, Kraken or Gemini, or use Bittylicious, or other p2p methods like: https://kycnot.me/

What sort of interest rate are you looking at? Because you would need BTC to outperform your interest every month in order to not lose money,  and that's not taking into account the possibility for downward movement. 

Even if you think that's likely to be the case, you will need to deduct the interest you're paying from your gains, and as we pointed out above, there's no guarantee that you WILL have gains to deduct from. 

What length of loan are you looking at? With what sort of interest rates? What do you plan to do should the situation turn sour?

Cops controlling the protests have blasted the farmers with ice cold water during the early days of protest when the farmers were far more peaceful. They're also not budging and resolving to dirty tactics of propoganda against them. It means the farmers still aren't enough of a threat for the govt to use force. Remember1.3B people here & the majority aren't taking part in the protests. The huge numbers you see are only fractions of the total population here.

No one in general gets shot in India, but they do get beaten up and maimed for the rest of their life for the silliest of things. 

The farmers protests are the only protests that can be done in this country because of the huge farming population and political backing for farmers. Every election is focused around them. They are their golden goose.

India has the highest number of internet shutdowns & censorship & no one protested. Most people here too backward to care about liberty & rights. Most of them gave no idea of crypto either. All they care is Modi is doing something and it should be good. They only care about water, land & agriculture.

While apple & US companies at least say they're not gonna hand over customer data, Indian companies like airtel publicly offer the govt our data & encourage govt control. They're still in the boomer mindset when it comes to privacy & rights.

I fully intend to pay it off earlier and it doesn‚Äôt have a penalty, and I‚Äôm truly hoping that BTC goes to 100k by the end of the year. Then, I‚Äôll take 50% and pay off the loan, leaving 50k in bitcoin (hopefully half a bitcoin) that maybe in 2-yes can pay off my mortgage.

What you're also not factoring in is the psychological hit of a bear market.

2214,gnqxqnh,t1_gnqoilf,"You would be insane to do this with an 8% rate. I can't say this clearly enough but this is a terrible idea. 

If your goal is to stop working extremely long shifts, going into large amounts of debt on hopium is probably the last way to go about it. On top of that,  I hate to be the bearer of bad news but 50k isn't going to change that either, at least not for very long. 

If it's truly your first time dabbling in investing,  rule #1 is DO NOT INVEST WHAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. Again, I don't mean to be harsh, but if you're taking out loans to buy crypto, you can't afford it. I don't care what your salary is. There's money management issues that need to be handled if this is truly your only option.

Please, speak with a financial advisor, or someone similar. It's possible you could make a 130% return, but it's also possible that you're going to be saddled with $1000 of regret every month for four years. Not great for paying off your mortgage in two.

Edit: So I did the math and realized you would be paying 66,000 total for the privilege of owning ‚Çø at 50k. See the problem? You're essentially betting 1/4th of everything you make on on the possibility that BTC not only hits 66k, but exceeds it to such an extent that the risk is worth the possible rewards. 

Imo you would need BTC to go well past 100k to make it worthwhile, and extract the kind of value you're hoping for.

People in the middle ages didn't really trade, they were subsistence farmers who occasionally sold surplus at markets, but this was mostly to pay taxes with, and even there, most people paid taxes in kind (e.g. grain from the harvest).

Market liquidity is dependent upon surplus and infrastructure, so people need something to trade, and they need the means to move goods and services. Since both of these factors would be severely impaired on Fallout 3: RL Edition, it stands to reason gold coins wouldn't have much purchasing power.

I'm retarded, but I suspect that the values of physical gold and silver are heavily suppressed presently, though. There's already a shortage of physical silver, yet $SLV (paper silver) did not commensurately rise. They're supposed to go out and buy physical silver to back your purchase into $SLV, but that sounds 100% legit no scam. I have no evidence of this, of course (I'd probably be dead if it existed and I did), but I'd never buy into dumb shit like $SLV and $GOLD. Shiny coins only, so I can pretend to be Scrooge McDuck.

Tesla might sell a mil cyber trucks / tesla from the perceived 'bitcoin / tesla community' partnership, and profit $50 Bil from Bitcoin appreciation as others follow.

Tesla could do this over 3 years, strengthening it's Balance Sheet position, while increasing sales insanely (far cheaper than super bowl ads), and get a perceived quick return on investment allowing excess profits to be spent on either stock buybacks or bitcoin, whichever is more suitable, as opposed to largely 'building cash' which is of little purpose (save buybacks).

If the value of the company goes up by $100 billion, he can exercise those options which would be equivalent to 1% of the value of the company.  This encourages him to grow the value of the company.

Since the US is printing new money like crazy, we are probably devaluing the dollar by 20% per year and all that freshly printed money is going into companies like tesla- increasing their price in dollars by 20% per year.  The less each dollar is worth, the higher his companies value goes when measured in dollars, and the more stock options he can exercise. 

There are probably many other CEO's and upper management in the same boat right now- everyone getting super rich in this way as the country destroys its currency so there is very little motivation to stop this feedback loop that we've been in since at least 2008.  The good news is, if those people are smart then they move that money they are making over into bitcoin to preserve its value, making the price of bitcoin keep going up too.

Since then, besides reading, watching anime, and playing lots of games, I've been making a game of my own. I'm already pretty familiar with code, but now I'm branching out into pixel art, sound, music, story, design, etc. Lots of new hobbies to explore.

That might just sound like more work to some, but there's a world of difference between ""want to"" and ""have to.""",t3_lljc8p,2021-02-17 11:33:55,2021-02-17

So what if you have to go back to work? If you can buy a year of freedom in your prime you have to take that chance. It‚Äôs something you will never be able to buy again no matter how much money you make.

I have gone about 50/50 on bitcoin and building a company. I figure two high risk ventures is more fun than one. Getting ready to launch next week actually.

It took me 3 years to figure it out so prepare for some existential crisis along the way.  Also some confusion/shade being thrown your way by family and friends is normal.  Getting rich on crypto is awesome! But not haveing a job working for the man and generating an traditional income really ruffles feathers. Cut these people some slack, their sense of self or status maybe tied to their job and getting paid so your decision puts them in direct conflict with their self esteem/worth.

I was able to do this in 2017-2018, all be it with Ethereum.  I was able to get out of the market at a good time.  I diversified into stocks to generate some income but have def been enjoying this recent run.  Happy to say I now own 0 ethereum and only BTC!

I've gotten incredibly annoyed with my regular day job because of Bitcoin and I'm making more trading stonks. Fortunately, the day job takes almost no effort and pays 6 figures, so I can put in part time hours on both stonks and day job for maximum gains.

My trade size is typically 10% so really I'm only exposing 2.5% at most to an exchange. It is really hard to get wrecked by an exchange failure if you only ever give them 2.5% of your portfolio at most at any point in time.

This year my trade size was over 2 million at one point. So I deposited 500K worth of BTC I wanted to sell on an exchange I have used for a couple of years that has no fiat withdrawal limits. In 3 business days the funds I withdraw arrive in my bank account and from there I split off what I need for taxes and the rest gets transferred to my broker.

I've always been careful to control the **big three**: housing, transportation, and food. These are the areas where you can **unconsciously** spend large amounts of money.

Whenever I took a job, I would find the cheapest housing I could within walking or biking distance, even if it was a tiny room in someone's house. Food has always been the hardest category to control, for me.

Trillion pre-mined coins, completely centralized, bought an existing project's name in order to steal the reputation created through remarks people made about an entirely different system.  And in the recent litigation it's now been made public that they were, in fact, paying for the little supposed adoption they had-- in other words it's all fake.

There is absolutely a place in the world for centralized databases.  But there is no reason for some centeralized database to print a new currency out of thin air and award it to its creators--  except to make them unfathomably rich by exploiting people who don't have the time or technical background to see through the scheme.

And sure, the SEC is pathetic and weak and basically just goes away with a few million in a settlement bribe,  so it's *possible* that the remaining XRP holders will find greater fools to dump their coins on in the future and won't be too undercut by the xrp operators/founders doing the same.  But it's also extremely possible for it to go the other way.

https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/

I mean, there's even someone who calculated the bitcoin hashs by hand, with pen and paper, although it was only 0.67 hashes a day. SHA-256 has nothing nefarious in it: http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html

Also bitcoin's code is itself open source, so anyone can examine the code and find any NSA backdoors, if there were any. Not that they need any, since it's an open ledger, they can build their own systems to follow transactions. That's why coins like Monero exists.

I can totally believe Bill Gates founded Microsoft as a kid, there are kids just as young as him founding new things all the time, even in the tech world (hell, my brother and I had a fully-running community website for posting and sharing stories and poems when we were in our teens, but we made some mistakes and moved on to other things...should have stuck with it in retrospect, probably could have become big if we kept at it). 

Not all become as big as Microsoft, but they're just as technical or interesting or potentially disruptive. And if Microsoft was all a government front, why are they not still super-dominant in the world, like Facebook is?

While the government is very much in the business of tracking its own people without telling them, as Edward Snowden uncovered, I don't believe they are the secret creator of each of these companies/technology. They have and desire influence and power over them, sure, but they didn't create them.",t3_lljc8p,2021-02-17 21:19:08,2021-02-17

4010,gnqakao,t3_ll2t82,"Boys and Girls.....

I come to you as a 41 year old boomer‚Äôs son.  Worked the last 18 years for publicly traded banks.  Parents said ‚Äúget a good job with a good company and stick with it.‚Äù  I worked hard to do it.....boom!

My Dad worked in the same office for 40 years.  Great man, took care of me and my mom.  Great Depression era parents from the dirty south. It‚Äôs what they were taught to become, and they did it successfully (and I thank them).

FUCK THAT for us.  I figured it out 18 years later than I should have.....hopefully this helps some of you youthful tards.....

The last 12 years of my life was ‚Äúemployed‚Äù at a bank that was about $2.5B in assets when I started there (because it was still ‚Äúlocal‚Äù).  When I resigned from a well, healthy position in late 2020, the bank had grown to north of $28B.  Still a great bank, with great leadership, but due to government regulation, the bitch had grown into a bureaucratic cesspool of thick, slimy butt-plug juice that only Jack Welch could appreciate in his early years as a youthful CEO.

That‚Äôs what our government does to business.  We‚Äôve all witnessed it here with Wall Street/the SEC/etc.  It‚Äôs undeniable.  Anything the government gets involved with that should be free-economically managed gets soiled like 60% of our senators depends after a lush lunch listening to Janet Yellen doing a repeat of a Citadel speech.

Why did I leave?  Had a relatively cush job with an incredible comp package.  Because I couldn‚Äôt live with it anymore, period.  How can my young children let Dad tell them what I‚Äôm doing is fulfilling and show them this is what they should become?  I‚Äôd become a young goat on the teet of a government run operation masked by a corporation.

I know more about banking than most of you degenerates can fathom.  All the tricks, the accounting, the games, the government relations, the levers to pull, etc.  

Do your own diligence.....here me, please.  Do your own diligence, but our banking system (the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve) fears what‚Äôs currently happening with Bitcoin with the fear of losing their lush mansions and BMW‚Äôs.  

The world reserve currency is quite important.  It allows US to print our way out of any problem.  Helicopter money style as we are seeing now, bitchez!

What is driving the price of Bitcoin up I‚Äôll ask you?  It ain‚Äôt Elon, it ain‚Äôt Redditors like us (though I wish it was!)......it‚Äôs fear that the US Dollar is going to lose value, fucking period.  Fucking period.  Fear of inflation (google that, or I can explain it to you).

Let me ask you......do you think the current government administration (regardless of your stupid political party side-I‚Äôm politically chaotic neutral) is going to do anything other than diminish our currency value?  ü§î

If you‚Äôre answer is ‚Äúno,‚Äù it‚Äôs worth doing your diligence on Bitcoin.  

So all you asshats don‚Äôt say I‚Äôm here to pump Bitcoin, I own 1.002 of it.  That‚Äôs all, right now.",t3_ll2t82,2021-02-17 12:26:04,2021-02-17

4531,gnnlwxc,t1_gnnhtoc,"Possibly my favourite drug of all time. Intense, vividly colourful and sharp, whilst also seeming incredibly dream like at the same time, although it‚Äôs almost impossible to describe accurately.

Also if you ‚Äòblast off‚Äô too many times in one sitting, the trips become less and less vividly colourful and fun, and can get a bit darker, but worst case scenario you have to ride it out for 10-15 mins tops and then you‚Äôre back, so it‚Äôs easy to be brave üòÇüòÇ

My only advice is, have minimal people with you, ideally one or two other people max. Don‚Äôt all do it at once, take turns to guide each other and when your friend has blasted off, just sit quietly and let them go, as any noise you make can really disturb their journey.

Start small, build up, a bit of pink Floyd playing in the background helps to set the mood too. My last bit of advice is lay down after you take your third hit, and close your eyes, don‚Äôt fight it, just let it take you. You can trip with your eyes open, and it is still very interesting, but to truly blast off, eyes closed, lay down, hear the music and see where you end up üò¨üò¨üöÄüöÄüõ∏üõ∏üõ∏
