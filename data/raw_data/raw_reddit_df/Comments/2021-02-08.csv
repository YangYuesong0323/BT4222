133,gmku97a,t1_gmklsd0,"> SPV and bloom filters... are they still a thing nowadays?

No,  Bloom filters from the same SPV peer can often be AND-ed together to get a reasonable guess of what addresses the SPV peer is actually interested in.

The modern counterproposal is Neutrino aka block-level filters.  Instead of an SPV peer saying ""this is a list of addresses I'm interested in (plus some false positives)"" aka SPV-peer Bloom filters, block-level filters have the fullnode saying ""this block involved transactions in this list of addresses (plus some false positives)"" then the SPV peer looks into each block's filter and decides whether to download the block or not based on each blocks' filter.

The latter is better for privacy since an SPV peer can gather a bunch of block-level filters then gather a fixed number of blocks (usually just one) from a fullnode peer, then disconnect and avoid connecting to the same peer again.  This reduces the information leak of the SPV peer.

Bloom filters are now deprecated and you should use block-level filters.  See BIP158/BIP157 for technical minutae.

Pruned nodes are fullnodes, they just aren't archival fullnodes.  Bloom filters are incompatible with pruned nodes, but in theory pruned nodes can maintain block-level filters (not sure if the Bitcoin core implementation does).  Fullnodes (both pruned and archival) download every block and validate every block.  SPV nodes reduce their block downloads by a variety of techniques, such as asking some trusted server about what blocks involve what addresses.  Both SPV and pruned fullnodes reduce local storage space.  Both pruned fullnodes and archival fullnodes consume the same amount of Internet bandwidth.

* SPV: low disk storage, low bandwidth.
* pruned: low disk storage, high bandwidth.
* archival: high disk storage, high bandwidth.

Generally disk storage is cheap but Internet bandwidth is expensive, so the main distinction is between SPV vs fullnodes (pruned and archival).

If you're using software that depends on Bloom filters be warned, you should probably shift, they are deprecated and at some point will no longer be supported.",t3_lf9hsi,2021-02-08 21:24:24,2021-02-08

Don't trade. You will be competing with market participants that are much better (more informed, access to more data, better emotional state, larger bankroll, better tech etc etc).

It's trivially easy to code a 1 second block time, instead of 10 minutes, but this destroys the decentralization/stability of the network, f.ex.   

Usually, any ""improvement"" requires a trade off somewhere. On a very basic, simplified level it's like a trilemma where you have to pick two: secure - fast - cheap. If you want it fast and cheap, it won't be secure (the fastest and cheapest network is a fiat payment network like SWIFT). If you want it secure and fast, it won't be cheap. And secure and cheap won't be fast.  

This is very simplified and hence not a very correct description, but hopefully close enough to reality to explain my point.  

Add ""easy verifiability"" and ""hardcapped supply"" into the mix, and no coin will come close to what bitcoin has to offer. If this offer has any value to you is up to you, but if you want those properties, you won't be able to find them anywhere else currently.

What makes a good money?

Well, first, why do we even need money in the first place?  Think about it: you make some product or provide some service, then you get paid in money, then you buy whatever product or service you want using the money.  That is two separate transactions.  Wouldn't it be more efficient to remove the money middleman and just trade  directly, cutting the number of required transactions in half?

Except that it's hard to discover a confluence of wants, where I have something you want and you want something I have.  Rather than direct barter, a money-based economy must arise, because finding a confluence of wants is hard.  Instead of trading directly, want for want, you trade what somebody wants for money, then trade for your own wants with money.

So what makes a good money?  It would be some number of properties:

* Easy to split up into smaller parts, so that you can pay for arbitrarily small trades.
* Easy to verify is ""correct"", i.e. has physical properties that can be easily checked.
* Easy to secure, i.e. who ""owns"" the money is the one who can decide how to spend it.
* Easy to move around.
* Hard to create more of.

Now, let's consider ancient times with low technology and small community sizes.

* Gold is malleable and can be made into very thin sheets, or thick gold bars, thus being easily split into smaller parts.  It's soft enough that a reasonably strong adult human can break a gold coin in half with some effort, if they wanted to pay something worth half a gold coin.
* Gold is a shiny yellow metal that ordinary human eyes can evaluate.  It's a heavy dense metal as well, which human hands can also evaluate.
* Gold can be formed into jewelry, and can be easily worn on or pierced into the human body.  In an era where there is no such thing as a dedicated ""police"" caste and every adult human secures their own personal possessions, being able to place your wealth on your body is very good security --- even if you have to sleep, somebody trying to get the gold you have pierced on your nipples is going to have a lot of difficulty acquiring it without you noticing.
* Given the small sizes of communities, and the relatively low values of goods in a low-technology economy, a human can travel a few days wearing their wealth as jewelry and then trading it for actual goods at a different location.
* Readily-accessible gold is limited, thus hard to get more supplies of gold.

But what happens with higher technology?

* Gold remains malleable and easy to split up into small pieces, so no change there.
* Higher technology means we can now make fake gold much more easily than before in low technology civilizations.  
* Higher technology allows for much more dangerous personal-level attacks, and the rise of a dedicated armed ""police""/""soldier"" caste implies that the ability to personally defend yourself from attack is much harder, thus jewelry on your body may make you a target, not secure your money.
* Greater global economies and much higher-value goods means we need to transport larger amounts of gold, at further distances (across continents).
* Increasing technology makes it easier (more economically feasible) to acquire gold, increasing gold supply and reducing gold price relative to other goods, which exacerbates the transportation problem --- with the higher gold supply, you need to transport more gold in exchange for the same trade good.

Thus, Bitcoin seeks to be a better money, in modern times, than gold:

* It can be split down to 0.00000001 of a Bitcoin.  With more technology (e.g. Lightning which can do as low a millisatoshi units) that means pretty good divisibility.
* While a human brain cannot validate Bitcoin, we do have modern tools (computers) capable of validation, and with open-source readily-available software for Bitcoin validation, anyone can easily validate any Bitcoin transfer.
* High cryptographic security makes it harder for even heavily-armed soldier-castes to steal Bitcoin --- the ability to hide a small piece of paper and keep its location secret is something no amount of guns can allow theft.
* Internet-native, thus money can be transported trivially, in large amounts, across continents.
* As a consensus system, agreement to change the supply is needed from all users.  Since users are not going to agree to change supply (it would not be rational of existing owners to agree to such) it is practically impossible to change the supply of Bitcoin.

Thus, that is the value that Bitcoin provides, value that can be determined from basic observation, without requiring faith.",t3_lf9hsi,2021-02-08 22:19:10,2021-02-08

As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.

You have been told that you are a SPECTATOR in the game of markets, that you are WATCHING a game being played out in front of you by lots of different companies.

You have been told that you should make ‘bets’ on those companies based on how well you think those companies can play the game that you are watching. The companies will play the game and they will keep score by ‘beating’ or ‘missing’ on revenues and earnings and the like, and then that score will determine whether or not your bets pay off.

You have been told that the better you are at ‘analyzing’ the teams playing this game, the more ‘due diligence’ you put into studying the teams playing this game, the more money you will make with your bets.

You have been told that everyone can win with their bets, that this is how you, too, can achieve the wealth that you *deserve*.

You have been told that the odds are ever in your favor.

*You have been told this for your entire life.*

Maybe I'm completely wrong. But that's how it's looked for the last 2 weeks.

Bitcoin has the chance to spark a revolution, but the way the community views it just ain’t it. It needs to start with some middle ground, not an outright stripping of power of other currencies. It should be viewed as a movement towards the future, not an opposition to the present. Bitcoin should not be the end goal, but it started society in the right path.

The companies will play the game and they will keep score by ‘beating’ or ‘missing’ on revenues and earnings and the like, and then that score will determine whether or not your bets pay off.

You have been told that the better you are at ‘analyzing’ the teams playing this game, the more ‘due diligence’ you put into studying the teams playing this game, the more money you will make with your bets.

You have been told that everyone can win with their bets, that this is how you, too, can achieve the wealth that you *deserve*.

2519,gmkz4zd,t1_gmky3qf,"> What number do you get when you combine 33% federal on 20% provincial?

No I specifically sought after provinces with 20% ceilings because I wanted to make that 53% number work. But again, since you're in Ontario it's a 46% ceiling. But also the way taxation works is scaled, so you're only taxed 46% on everything PAST $220,000. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of taxes, I just want to dispel any confusion that you're actually being taxed 53%, because you're not. you're being taxed 5% on your first 45k, 9.15% on the next 15k, 11.16% on the next 11k, etc etc.  

My $5M/year is just an arbitrary number where it would actually start to resemble half of your total income going to taxes. On $1m per year you actually pay close to 50%, but on $220,000, you actually only pay 36% of your annual income into taxes.",t3_leycab,2021-02-08 22:13:27,2021-02-08

> Two weeks ago, the billionaire Tesla owned added the hashtag #bitcoin to his Twitter bio, in a move that helped to briefly push up the price of the cryptocurrency by as much as 20%. Two days later, he said on the social medial chat site Clubhouse: &quot;I do at this point think bitcoin is a good thing, and I am a supporter of bitcoin.""

> Bitcoin prices surged to new highs Monday following Tesla&#039;s announcement, reaching a price of at least $44,200.

This was way back in July when BTC was around 8k a coin. I met this dude at my local medical marijuana dispensary and we got to talking about money and investing. He wouldn't shut the fuck up about Bitcoin and how we all need to invest our money into it while it's low. The last thing he said before he left was ""I promise you won't regret it"". He spoke with alot of clarity and certainty, so that interaction stuck with me. The next few days I did my due diligence on researching Bitcoin and decided to toss around $1600 into it just to test the waters. I also called my dad, and somehow by the grace of of God, convinced him to invest into BTC. He bought 5k worth.

Fast forward to today and my dad and I both have more than doubled our investments. We've both since been investing more money into BTC and we follow it pretty closely. My dad is very happy with his BTC investment and I feel like a proud son for introducing him to it. And don't worry....we HODL. We see it being a retirement fund situation.

To that guy at the weed shop who told me to invest into BTC, thank you. Your advice not only has helped double my networth, but you helped strengthen my relationship with my father.

**Edit: It just occurred to me that the guy who was raving all about Bitcoin and told me to invest in it probably has made a ton of money from BTC since. He really believes in Bitcoin and spoke of it with conviction. He opened my eyes to a whole new world of currency. I'm sure he's sitting on an extremely generous profit.

3356,gmhqyxr,t1_gmho4ps,"Wallet is where you hold your Cryptocurrencies. Each wallet has a public key and a private key. Keep your private keys and/or seed phrases **safe**. Public key can be used to generate your receiving addresses. Seed phrases are a set of random words used to generate the private key.

If an exchange doesn't give you the private keys of your wallet, you don't hold the funds yourself. That's called a custodial wallet. Generally it's better to keep your funds in your own wallet (non-custodial). Not your keys, not your coins.

For a wallet interface, there are many apps available on play store. My favorite one is Trust Wallet by Binance. Some people prefer to use Hardware Wallets or directly write their keys on paper and save crypto that way without entering it anywhere else aka Paper Wallets. Be sure to not give your keys to any suspicious wallets. Whoever has the private key controls the funds. Most wallets with good reviews on play store are generally trustable.

3366,gmhtb8x,t1_gmhqyxr,"As someone who's been doing Bitcoin a long time, one thing that's always bugged me is the use of the term ""wallet"" and ""address"" when they could have chosen ""account"".  There's a lot of confusion around what wallet and address mean, and your answer is an unfortunate example of this, and I don't blame you at all for the mistake because it's super common.

What you're describing is the public & private key pair; the public half of this is referred to as the address, and the private half doesn't really have a name, although mostly people refer to it as ""your key"".  The wallet is just something you use to keep track of addresses - it can be a piece of paper, or your memory (if you can memorize the seed phrase), or specialized hardware, or just a file on your computer somewhere.

I really wish they had just gone with account (for the public key), key (for the private key) & keychain for these terms - they're things that everyone understands and keychain is a better term than wallet, since a bitcoin wallet doesn't actually contain any money like a real wallet does.  Account is something people are used to sending money to, and looking at to see their balance.  Address is too computer-y.",t3_lenjsz,2021-02-08 03:32:48,2021-02-08

To me, keychain sounds like a bad analogy. Suppose you keep your funds in a safe that you can lock. You don't put the key and the safe together and call that a keychain. You keep the keychain with the key, away from the safe.

We have a distinction between address and a key because in normal transactions, we don't need to have a key to send or receive funds from your wallet. To receive funds, you show your hands and to send you need to hold the wallet. Here the hands are the address of the owner and keys are the owner's authority.

3380,gmhz5o3,t1_gmhvdjp,"But your cryptocurrency's not ""in"" your wallet - your private keys are.  And you can have multiple wallets, all with the same keys, so the metaphor breaks down - copying your wallet doesn't double your money.

The blockchain is a public ledger with a number of features that allow it to be maintained in a decentralized fashion.  Ledgers are for keeping track of account balances.  You don't have to have a bank to have accounts - accounts can be maintained by any entity wanting to track who owes what to whom and the history of transactions.

I'm not sure what you mean by putting a key with the safe.  A crypto wallet (keychain) has no money in it - the address (account) does.  

ID is just as bad as address, IMO.  Both are super generic terms in computer science and for all practical purposes, information-free, other than saying ""this thing has a unique location.""",t3_lenjsz,2021-02-08 04:14:31,2021-02-08

About calling the whole thing a wallet - it doesn't make sense literally, but it still seems better than calling it a key-address pair. Wallet or account.

The wallet idea can be thought of like - all you have in the account is your cryptocurrencies, so we might as well call it a wallet.
