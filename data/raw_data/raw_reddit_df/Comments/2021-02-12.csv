i am curious to know what everyone's planned eventual use is for their satoshis/btc.

133,gn1h47g,t3_li5ulc,"Hello, got some questions on terminology here and a few processes to check my understanding is correct.

So there are deterministic wallets (so also presumably non deterministic exist), where you generate a seed which is a phrase of words, and from this seed, the wallet addresses can be calculated. A wallet address is actually just a private and public key combo, and the address is just a hash of the public key. You could back up just this private and public key data if you wanted to backup that address? If there are non deterministic I suppose you can just generate a new private and public key pair to use as an address? But this can't be recovered with a seed.

When you send bitcoin, how does the system verify that you are the one that sent it. There must be some handshake or something with your private key I guess, what happens here? 

Is my understanding here correct, anything else I should know?

With hardware wallets which part of this do they effect? They store just the keys? So they're offline essentially. I read somewhere about trezor that the device has to verify the transaction so your coins can't be spent without the device, how does this work?

I'm holding bitcoins since 2017, kept on buying all the way from 2017 until now. Last year at around 12k ‚Ç¨ I thought about selling a bit for a car but I stopped myself from doing it.

I really want to wait 5 more years and then look if I can buy an apartment or house. In germany its pretty expensive and where I live you have to pay around 350k ‚Ç¨ for a 3-room-apartment. and about 450k ‚Ç¨ for a 4-room-apartment.

359,gn1pxy8,t1_gn1h47g,">When you send bitcoin, how does the system verify that you are the one that sent it. There must be some handshake or something with your private key I guess, what happens here?

When you send bitcoin, your wallet software creates a transaction and signs it with the private key(s) of the address(es) that you send from. That's how you prove that you are allowed to send those coins.

A hardware wallet does this signing for you. Your wallet software creates the desired (unsigned) transaction, sends it to the hardware wallet (via USB in case of Trezor) then the HW signs the transaction and sends the signed transaction back. The wallet software can then send it to the bitcoin network. This way, the transaction gets signed without the private keys ever leaving the hardware wallet. So a virus or trojan on the device where the wallet software runs cannot steal the keys.  
The virus could however change the transaction before it is sent ot the HW. I.e. you enter the target address A into the wallet software. Before the wallet software creates a transaction from this, the virus changes this, behind the scenes, to the target address B (which is owned by the attacker who installed the virus). So the transaction that is sent to the HW for signing now contains the address B. If this transaction were signed and used, it would redirect your transfer to the attacker. The virus could even change the amount that is coded into the transaction.  
To protect against such an attack, the HW has a display and shows you the amount and the target address that it finds in the transaction and asks you to confirm.

It is very important to double check this on the HW before confirming!",t3_li5ulc,2021-02-12 19:09:58,2021-02-12

>What‚Äôs the end game? Is crypto supposed to replace traditional currency entirely? Or is it just supposed to remain a secondary form of payment indefinitely?

Depends on who you ask, many have different visions of the future. This can range from bitcoin replacing gold and similar assets as a store of value, to something much larger like becoming the global reserve currency. Nobody really knows.

My personal take is that people tend to prefer digitised and decentralised systems where possible, and so that's where the market will take us in the next few decades. 

&#x200B;

>If it completely replaced traditional currency, how would transactions at retail stores work? Would a cashier tell you your total is 0.000014583 BTC? Or would there be a new basis for pricing? 

A new basis for sure. This is something the market will decide organically really, and perhaps different retailers would adopt different metrics. On the main chain, the smallest unit of divisibility is the satoshi (0.00,000,000 bitcoin, or \~5000 sats for a cup of coffee).",t3_li5ulc,2021-02-12 18:16:29,2021-02-12

no difficulty of adding a block to the chain. transaction verification is not done by miners. full nodes do it.

>Yah I'm referring to far future when mining is done and dusted and transaction fees are the only thing incentivising miners.

mining will never be done and dusted. if you don't have miners you can't use bitcoin because miners are the ones that add transactions to the blockchain. the block subsidy that they get will wither away to next to nothing so they will rely on transaction fees for their revenue.

you should read up on how bitcoin works because you have a fundamental misunderstanding of it.

Enter Modern Time Banking. Volunteer activity and community engagement would be tracked by an app and seeded, initially, by the government. After that, local administrators would oversee the program.

You could earn time banking points through:

    Volunteering at a local shelter

    Coaching little league
    Fixing a neighbor‚Äôs appliance
    Working with those recovering from opiate addiction
    Tutoring a local student

and a range of other activities that make your community stronger.  

We‚Äôve seen the power of these awards systems to drive behavior through online communities, ‚Äúfree sandwich‚Äù punch cards, and special status (e.g. Yelp Elite, Foursquare mayors, etc.).

Signing up for an account would allow you to track your running tally, along with an ‚Äúunspent‚Äù total. As noted above, you could offer time banking points to a neighbor for watering your plants or taking your mail in while you‚Äôre away.

So firstly, it's not a policy. It's a question. It's also not ""invasive in civil liberties""-- at least no more than your birth certificate, driver's license, or medical records, and those ARE actually required. 

And more importantly, it is not ""every american should receive a barcode"" or that ""we can be tracked"". A volunteered app that comes with a barcode is not the same thing as Fascists forcing everyone to have a barcode tattooed to track them.  

Finally, is this really that bad? For example, there have been a requirement for anyone flying into the country to provide a negative Covid test. If this was moved to a phone app, would this be ""totalitarian"" and an invasion of civil liberty? 

This is what we call ""slippery slope fallacy""-- when we say ""oh this bad thing isn't happening now, but if this happens, it might happen ONE DAY!"" and then we act as if it's the problem now. 


And then you see how it's re-interpreted [by the media](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bronsonstocking/2020/12/18/yangs-call-for-proofofvaccination-barcodes-should-worry-all-freedom-loving-americans-n2581837):

*""I'm watching AOC selling 'Tax the rich' T-shirts for $58 while businesses are leaving New York. That's AOC's solution. Who is going to pay $58 for a T-shirt when you're out of a job?""*

*""We're in the middle of a pandemic. People say, 'If we only had Amazon.' We got nothing.""*

*""I'm angry at the stupidity. Everybody fears AOC, who has no idea what she's doing. Opposing Amazon benefited other communities. Imagine if AOC did something positive with her big mouth,"" Cerbone told the Post.*

Nice way to try to deflect from the truth by playing an irrelevant race card. However, I'll give you a Bitcoin comment. You realize the farther left one goes politically, the more they're embracing larger, more controlling government, and rising taxes to pay for said government, and less freedom right? Well, AOC is about as left as they come in the U.S. Congress. Bitcoin is the *opposite* of all that - it favors *freedom* and *individual choice*, most importantly *economic* freedom. So a true Bitcoin supporter is as far right as possible, which is a libertarian (like myself), or anarcho-capitalist. That's why libertarian-leaning presidential candidate Rand Paul accepted Bitcoin for his presidential run in 2016. Should it come to laws regarding freedom to use Bitcoin, AOC is on the party side of (Democrat) Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who spoke of ""curtailing"" Bitcoin.",t3_lhx8rz,2021-02-12 13:48:07,2021-02-12

Might reduce the value of btc substantially but it should hopefully even out the volatility quite a bit.

Also confused why they chose btc over a currency that has a smaller conversion rate? Buying a Tesla w/ \~1 bitcoin is one thing but paying 0.0004 of a btc for a ride seems a bit awkward/intangible for the average rider. BTC also seems like a weird choice as it has remarkably slower transaction speeds than other similar cryptos, which I assume would be important to uber given the sheer volume of transactions that they go through at any given time.

use to work, grandpa

bitcoin is only ""storing value"" so the reasons to use a house to do that will diminish over time (theoretically obv) 

Id rather store value in something built to only STORE VALUE and move it to others that want that value later. Rather than having something Im living in or renting out and expect a buyer to be there with mortgage approval (and secure job) 5-10 years down the road 

One is built only to secure, store and transfer value between people digitally 

The other requires the realtor, assessment, land titles, mortgage approval AND a buyer down the road that wants to own the thing....the fees on that sale will always be higher and take longer than bitcoin...always... 

Lets see after covid how the job market looks but everything is pumping because ""something"" is going to get rekt by the time this is done

The way the LN is constructed, it's still tied to the blockchain, just not directly. Coins sent to the LN are locked on the main chain by a HTLC (hash timelocked contract) that basically says ""these coins are locked between you and the person you opened the channel with until one of you closes the channel. On the LN the transactions are secured in their own similar but different way. So no, there's no trust involved.

The reason the closed end funds have a concept of supply and demand on the secondary market is because of the fact that the number of shares issued is locked in.  So you have a limited supply.  When demand goes up for the closed end fund because of the limited supply of units available for purchase it creates a premium.

For an ETF there is no supply problem.  It is in continuous distribution  meaning it can create units anytime.

The reason ETF ever trades wide is not because demand, it's because the market makers cant hedge the portfolio or they are not confident on what makes up the ETF.",t3_lhyoul,2021-02-12 16:37:52,2021-02-12
