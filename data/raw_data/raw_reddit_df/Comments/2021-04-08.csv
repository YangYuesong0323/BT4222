I can't imagine spending any BTC anytime soon since it is an investment and I am expecting long term gains. Maybe down the road when it becomes the norm I would consider it, but even then I might just take a loan against it because I don't want to lose it.

So many people talking about the energy-consumption of bitcoin but for years they did not care about their own lifestyle or any other industry that uses a lot of energy.

I just often see that people have this black white thinking that something uses a lot of energy so it must be bad and be banned.

Now the price is retreating again to test if it will return to being **under** the EMA bands or **above**. 

If it stays under the EMA bands and cannot rally then you‚Äôll see sharper corrections incoming of far larger %s. 

So far I‚Äôm not seeing any worthwhile buying pressure. If by tomorrow we are still above 56500 then you could probably say things are gaining ground. The next 12 hours is super critical.

Because all I‚Äôve been seeing on the money flow for weeks now is people basically selling Bitcoin. The selling has been unrelenting for weeks. The only reason the price is somewhat stable is because just enough have been buying to keep it somewhat up. 
But it‚Äôs been slowly crawling down for a while because the selling just keeps on going.

He is correct to note that bitcoin does threaten the dollar.  It threatens it in an indirect way, just as it does any centralized fiat currency.  That‚Äôs by design.  I‚Äôm sure he has read Satoshi‚Äôs white paper, so he knows about the decentralizing character of cryptocurrency.

So it‚Äôs very surprising to hear his comment, which is essentially that China, where apparently most bitcoin is mined, could harness the decentralizing power of bitcoin to threaten the dollar.  Considering that approximately 18 million bitcoins of a capped total of 21 million have already been mined, then there is not a lot left to mine for China to control.  My understanding is that Americans own a lot of the bitcoin, so China would have to buy that up - probably in dollars.  Where would China get those dollars?  And finally, if China buys all the bitcoin, nobody else can use it.  If nobody uses bitcoin, they have to use something for money like, say, the dollar.  I‚Äôd like to hear more about his comments because they‚Äôre not making a lot of sense to me.  They seem to lack context.

1531,gtsj2mp,t3_mminc1,"So the real ATH of bitcoin should be 200K, since that is the 10X ATH of 2017.   There are folks scared out of their minds about the current price, every time we dip sub 55K, they shit themselves.  I've been watching the price test 60K a few times and pull back...  I think that is the uncertainty and doubt at work, so this idea that its all bullish run  all the time is totally false.   I really feel that with the adoption and the institutional players including major banks that are now trying to get into the space, the price should be much higher, but because folks are so scared of a pullback, and 2017 repeating itself all over... any volatility in the position is magnified and newbs pull their btc back into stable coin probably at a great loss to them only to watch the price solidify and return back near 90-95 of ATH.    The amount of days its stayed in this position, is incredible in my opinion.   I think when it moves it will move big, but then all these folks jump in trying to long it and make all sorts of bank and their hooks slow down the raise.... till it sputters, and longs loose some, and bam it starts moving again, 10K up 5K down, 7K up, 4K down, 5K up, 3K down, than bam 10K up, and 7K down... Just a wave that tries its best to be as unpredictable as possible so that longs and shorts never quite know when.

&#x200B;

I really think if there was less grapple hooks in the price, the price would be close to 200K at this moment, instead, its steady climb with many pushes and fails.   Way more people trying to make bank off of the movement of the asset then in 2017 and it is proving hard to get the same sustained runway, as every move means siphoning value to coffers with grapplehooks.

1540,gtsk621,t3_mminc1,"There is one more point that is little talked about. First of all, it is the concentration of bitcoins in the hands of wealthy people. And that's the problem.

I am not saying bitcoins should be given out to poor people or anything like that. After all, people do not distribute money, cars, etc. I am now talking about educational activities among the common working class.

I just learned what Bitcoin is. I used to think that this is what criminals pay. Later I thought it was just a tool for speculating rich people. Then I thought that I could get it on a regular computer and earn a little money.

I think that accelerating the integration of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies into everyday life is possible only through the general educational process. And we can all help a little for that. If I knew how to program and I had the opportunities, I would create some kind of site. There are many of them now, but even more are needed.

I just started talking about bitcoins to my few acquaintances. And they tell me that this is all a pyramid scheme, and that I don't even need to think about it. Others said it was only for the rich. But Bitcoin is not a story about wealth. Of course, many see this as just an investment. I myself thought so, but as soon as I studied the topic in more detail, I realized that there really was something worthwhile behind it.

We have our own national currency, but some people keep their savings in dollars and euros. Bitcoin should become a common thing, not something inaccessible.

And I thank you for the time. Despite any difficulties in life, this is very cool. When this is how you can discuss global things with people from all over the planet.

Nowadays, a handful of people I know have some money invested in the market to varying degrees.  Unfortunately, unless I can talk them into taking custody, they all tend to go towards what they perceive as more convenient solutions like buying on Robinhood.

When I explain what is involved with buying from an actual exchange and moving Bitcoin onto a hardware wallet, almost invariably it goes ""that seems really complicated, I'm afraid I'd mess it up.""  If they go through with it, that immediately changes to, ""That wasn't so bad.""

There will never be full adoption. This is pure hype garbage from an interested party manipulating the market. True money understands how the world works: Force projection.

Bitcoin is worth zero - it has no force behind it and no economic underpinning. It‚Äôs super easy to kill the network, criminalize transactions, and track interactions.

And by the way- if the government has a warrant, why should it not be able to seize your assets? And if you disagree with that principle, what are you doing living with us? And what protection do you think you have once you do something against the laws the rest of us have agreed to abide by? Because we have drones and it‚Äôs very clear what happens when you breach the social contract and start killing us.

The concept of Nation State sovereignty is incompatible with Bitcoin- unless you were Satoshi.

Sure- make money on the way up. Watch as it‚Äôs crushed.

Central banks have governed human history for the last thousand years. You think there‚Äôs a crypto on the market that can avoid capital controls? You‚Äôre an idiot.

A bet on crypto is a bet against governments. And if you‚Äôre betting against governments, you‚Äôre betting the internet‚Äôs going down. And then how do you handle you‚Äôre crypto? I can do the math- can you?

First that‚Äôs not the only way to kill BTC.

1- The transactions and network have a recognizable pattern. The same way the NSA penetrated Tor by watching the in and out points, the BTC blockchain is monitored and the significant nodes can be targeted through an attack, taken offline, the 51% hash rate changed and a state agent assumes control, and moves all agreement immediately.

2- The concept of color. Clean coins vs dirty coins. You need to prove your coin is clean before entering the global financial system. Good luck.

3- Yes. Changing the internet so that all data needs to be whitelisted and cleared. NFTs are more prepared for this. Crypto gets fucked.

You guys are all idiots who don‚Äôt really understand what you can do with tech while keeping infrastructure and analyzing a community.

Proof of work protocols aren‚Äôt relevant to a human society. And without a network connection become meaningless and based on local processing power. You could do a random assigned seed and check who is still aligned but there‚Äôs no clear way to solve for asymmetric processing power on the level of a nation state vs an individual.

Second-

I‚Äôm an American. I don‚Äôt really give a ruck about Venezuela and I want us to use our control over the global financial system to benefit me. I went to Miami for a while and I‚Äôm back in NYC and I like my life. I‚Äôm not sure why I would want the dollar to fail and I‚Äôm not sure why I like crypto if it‚Äôs designed to be outside my DOJ and State Departments control. That makes no sense.

The US did something a few hundred years ago to the n-generals problem when it created a 67% solution with our federal government.

It‚Äôs literally moronic to think a 51% system is now better?

Win two world wars etc etc.

Bitcoin is a Chinese attack on US Dollar hegemony designed to activate dumb white disenchanted American libertarians.

Make money on the way up - but watch for the nukes on the way down.

It‚Äôs very difficult to kill an idea. But when everyone using a platform or technology needs an IP address and you know where that physical device is, it‚Äôs very easy to find the people.

1858,gtsmcg2,t1_gtskrtm,"1- That wasn‚Äôt whataboutism. Are you a moron or did you make a mistake? That was a parallel/analogy to how Tor was penetrated, which is what‚Äôs actually going on with the Blockchain- and more relevant because the BTC blockchain nodes are intentionally public. And by the way, calling you a moron isn‚Äôt ad hominem, because it‚Äôs a criticism fundamental to the argument. 

Thought experiment- I analyze the hash flow for a while over the BTC network. I localize where significant hash rates are coming from. I pick the right moment where I know how the network is operating, and then I kill all flow for 30 minutes from external entities, make it look like everything is operating normally to people on networks I control, make it look normal to networks externally with a processing power I can match, and then I don‚Äôt know, because I control ATT, Comcast, etc, I DNS attack significant nodes globally, and then have my own servers take control over the blockchain. Now imagine I actually do this in about 2 seconds. No one knows. 

2- You‚Äôre right. Crypto users don‚Äôt want it to show up somewhere. But the coins are identifiable and have a history and if you violate KYC or reporting laws and you buy something weird and you‚Äôre a US citizen, you will be found out. And if we pass a law about crypto laundering overnight it becomes a real problem. That direct transmission that seemed off the books becomes 20 years.

3- What does the election have to do with this? It doesn‚Äôt even matter to this conversation if the election was fair- and questioning it makes you look like a crazy propagandist - because there‚Äôs no question about it being legit, and you want to splinter the conversation from something real: that the rules of the internet are not political or global. The internet and communication can be modified instantly based on an order. No matter who is in charge any international communication is subject to the President‚Äôs will. Period.

Of course the petrodollar sucks for non western countries. That‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôs designed that way. We won WW2 and the Cold War.

But the US is the world. Everyone else can leave if they want- but we won. 

If you have a problem with that fly some more planes into our buildings and then see what happens.

1. bitcoin is not a stock. So you bought bitcoin + stocks. Not bitcoin + ""other stocks"". To bitcoiners this is not a trivial distinction.
2. Look into your own wallet. Cashapp is convenient for buying but their withdraw limits are weak sauce. If you get any appreciable value in bitcoin, it will take you a long time to get your money out. Plus I think they are running fractional just like everyone else. 
3. You already have $500 in bitcoin. You better start aiming a lot higher than $5k for your stack or your DCA won't last very long and you'll have to start selling soon. 10x from here is roughly gold parity - that's really just the beginning.

Some wise people on this sub told me one of the most important things about investing in cryptocurrencies; NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS!

What this means is if you buy coins from an exchange like Coinbase, they hold your private keys. If something would happen to Coinbase (hacks or whatever else can happen) your coins are gone and there is nothing you can do about it.

TL:DR - Buy a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger etc) and transfer your coins from the exchange to said hardware wallet. You are now the keeper of your of coins!",t3_mmonez,2021-04-08 20:30:01,2021-04-08

However, realize that to just double your investment to $1,000 the price of Bitcoin will have to go to $120,000. Which it will do in time, but if you want to make more gains sooner then I'd invest in Ethereum (or some other stock that will double, triple, etc... sooner). Ethereum is at $2,000 and has more growing potential than Bitcoin.

Again... awesome you're investing, but just something to keep in mind as a new investor.

I had a friend who recently started putting a couple hundred bucks here and there into Bitcoin and was underwhelmed by their gains and I explained to them why.

It's still a worthy investment but it's not like investing $500 in Bitcoin when it was $100 and that investment exploding into $300,000.

Keep up the investing though! Let your money work for you.

If you were investing this would mean that you would actually receive a return on investment which is not the case with Bitcoin. You're not going to receive any return on investment, any interest or dividend. You're simply holding a thing of value because you determined that based on its properties it is likely to keep its value and even appreciate the relative to a depreciating fiat currency. And ultimately you will exhange it for something else you will need or want in your life.

If you put yourself in the mindset of saving funnily enough it will also become much easier for you to not touch your savings and leave them alone even if the price of bitcoin moves to the downside because you know that you're saving and you want more bitcoins not more of fiat currency.",t3_mmonez,2021-04-08 21:36:31,2021-04-08

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks.

There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties

You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft

You are exposed to exit theft

You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

You place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence

1. Lawyer. You're in BTC. You pay a lawyer to make sure you will be able to not lose money, assets, or time. Promises rely on trust, hiring a lawyer puts that trust into paper which allows what the judges see as a transfer of liability.

All this 'DD', all these posts about how you are going to the moon, all these posts about apes together strong and... you never stop to think, if you are not special, if you are just a retard who read about it on reddit... if you are a part of such a monumental and paradigm shifting movement... why is every billionaire, every gedge fund, every investment bank... not piling in behind you for when it blows gold everywhere? Why are you still waiting for a 'whale' or a 'catalyst' when by your own admission you are not special?

Genuinely believe it could have gone to a grand a share before the market manipulation and price suppression. I also genuinely believe that for every 'hedge fund shill bot' telling you to sell, there was a bot telling you to HOLD THE LINE and APES TOGETHER STRONG while the people who got in before you sold at 350.

And then again at 250.

Royal you by the way, not the person I'm replying to.

Stock market is rigged against you and GME apes are playing a game they don't fully understand against players vastly better equipped. Never occurred to us GME retail investors that they could close one side of the market, did it? Guess what, it had occurred to the hedge funds! Never occurred to the GME retail investors that big firms could keep shorting the stock as it went higher, thus guaranteeing that it would have to go down eventually. Guess what?

We‚Äôve all heard of hallucinations and delusions and then the famous saying ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt judge a book by its cover‚Äù which all involves sight and visualization... But nothing regarding sounds and words... Say MyCryptoMixer repeatedly and you will with no doubt know it sounds Shady. This is because IT IS shady, that whole platform is based on a Ponzi scheme!!! They take on the guise of crypto mixers who work with anonymity and then use it to their advantage to vanish into thin air with your money. They then deny that you ever had any transactions with them.

Elon Musk is another proof, because he bought Bitcoin and saw the price falling trough critical levels towards 30k, he imediately posted bitcoin as a status on his Twitter. 

Microstrategy and Saylor stated the other day that they bought 15 million usd worth of Bitcoin at 59k - the strategy is to keep people interested and pump the price. Notice they brought just 15 million usd worth of BTC not 15 billion. Talking about 15 million is just peanuts for their multi billion fund, but they are smart.

The reason for this is that there's less mega whales as many already sold chunks for profit and with price raising they never bought back. Also, more markets, more trade, more people owning bitcoin, and less possible for the bigger whales to affect the price and manipulate the market. 
Also now there are more companies and organizations buying and holding, and these not only have the tendency to play in ways to keep the market stable, they will use their already established  power to influence the media and ltivates more people to buy. They will do everything to never sell bellow the proce that they bought even is for than they need to move important assets. 

I believe at some point many will want to cash out some profits, so they will do everything to cause panic, disbelief and take bitcoin from weak hands, but less and less people will fall for that, so we may see in the coming year some drops of 20%, but it will be going up again soon.

Beyond that I can only guess but I do think Bitcoin will go beyond 1m and 10m as Bitcoin becomes completely adopted and is the primary store of value for the globe.

You have time until it is commodified enough to be able to reverse a pubkey within 10 minutes reliably and also *cheaply* enough that it is worth doing.

Whether or not their suggestions are taken on board as a fix to some crisis depends on our collective will to not be poor (which is kind of strong).

So my main message is that despite whatever threats people cook up, as long as the future has any kind of handwave math where encryption is stronger than decryption, and where its possible for people to get coins in a new more secure address or system, then bitcoiners that are alive will take actions to preserve their own value.

Collectively, they will preserve all the value or as much of it as they can. If we thought a bad actor stole Satoshi's coins in order to fuck the rest of us over, we could probably come to consensus to cut those coins off, not kidding.

We could at least float different fork of bitcoin ideas, different algos, different ways of reacting, etc, as we explore the potential space of possibilities for preserving our value.

Like when the Germans invade Russia, do you just roll over and die, or do you make the T-34 tank at the tank factory and fight back?

[How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy qubits](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333338015_How_to_factor_2048_bit_RSA_integers_in_8_hours_using_20_million_noisy_qubits)

But I am no way knowledgeable enough to give any meaningful counter argument against it.   


however from their conclusion
