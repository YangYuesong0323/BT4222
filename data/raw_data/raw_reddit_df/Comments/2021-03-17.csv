2316,gr5g6v8,t1_gr59r1n,"I'm neutral. You *can* tell people how much you have, and many do all the time or imply it. Surely Andreas, Adam B... the Winklevoss Twins, etc... own some Bitcoin. Those who effectively threaten others, ""BUT YOU'RE not allowed to talk about BITCOIN, only the approve PROPHETS are allowed to talk about bitcoin!!"", bother me. Then they DOS you and make threats, and call it ""being helpful"" - it's nothing more than a threat to silence you.

If you know where Andreas will be at any point in time, then you have an easier access to Bitcoin then 'wrench' some internet stranger who could be lying... and people don't yell at him to shut up about Bitcoin, only others.

People need to talk about Bitcoin and normalize it, to some degree. I help others buy Bitcoin, and had 6 foot signs outside my office featuring Bitcoin for 5 years now, mailed out over 30,000 flyers promoting Bitcoin, with my name attached, little different than Andreas might.

You are allowed to talk about Bitcoin - and you are allowed not to. If you are on a new account and act an asshole, I won't be nice to you. I don't care how much you *know*, if you are an asshole, I won't like you.

The only part I agree with is discouraging the emotional, competitive nature of 'investing'. I don't like that. It's not good. We don't all need to spend all of our money buying Bitcoin, and we don't need competitions for who can get the dumbest tattoo or eat the most feces.

That's about all I agree with. Some like privacy, sure, take it. Some like Lopp are publicly involved in Bitcoin, and if others join him, I encourage it.

Censuring 'talking about Bitcoin' could make it easier to censure Bitcoin itself. You want to normalize Bitcoin.

Generically, I say I have 'one Bitcoin'. That is true. I have other assets too, I generally don't feel the need to discuss it.

The least engaging way to trade is to become competitive. 'Skin in the game' behavior, and disclosing your own biases, is OK. If I'm going nuts YOU MUST BUY BITCOIN - ANY PRICE IS GOOD - BUY AT NEW ALL TIME HIGH SAME AS BUYING AT LOWS!!! - and you ask, 'do you got bags of Bitcoin', well... maybe a fucking psycho like that does.

But ya, Bitcoin is just a thing. It doesn't mean you can't eat donuts, cause Bitcoin means carnivore diet. It doesn't mean you can't be Muslim, cause Bitcoin is for Christian fundamentalist. It doesn't mean you can't talk about Bitcoin, cause Bitcoin is for scared pricks who whine like a lil bitch on anon accounts.

You can do whatever you want.

Hell, I had people come on here just the other day and cry to me about how Bitcoin'ers don't support UBI and surrendering all their Bitcoins to random governments, and get massively upvoted.

I disagreed, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin isn't for them, too. I might not like said people, but they can say whatever they want... doesn't bother me, basically.

So, yes, you *can* talk about Bitcoin, owning Bitcoin, and if you feel so inclined you can say that you own as much as Andreas, Lopp, Adam, or whomever you choose... if they can talk about Bitcoin, so can you.",t3_m6bm55,2021-03-17 02:34:11,2021-03-17

GME shares at any given moment are worth exactly what the market determines, just like BTC is worth whatever the market determines. You may believe GME is overvalued in the long term, but that does not mean it‚Äôs current value of over $200 is incorrect in any way. Professional investors regularly buy securities they believe are overvalued in the long term simply because they believe that they can profit in the short term.

>	The chance of GME crashing back to below 50 dollars is 100% can u say the same of bitcoin?

There are many people who believe BTC has no inherent value and that it is only a matter time until the bubble pops and the price crashes down to 0. There is no way to know for sure if they are correct or not, in the end the market will decide.

>	anyone who hyped others into buying was right to be criticized.

I disagree completely. Anyone spreading misinformation deserves to be criticized, but people should be free to reasonably speculate or spread true information regarding investing in any way they see fit. Everyone who bought in at 20k and held their BTC are up over 150% on their investment right now, so in the end the people hyping it up at 20k saying it would eventually go higher were correct. Why should they be criticized for sharing a good investment opportunity with others?

Adults should have the freedom to participate in the market in whatever way they see fit as long as they are not participating in illegal activity. Some people will inevitably lose money, but this is the nature of a free market. There are two sides to every trade and in order for anyone to profit someone else has to lose, even if it is simply by selling too early. Investing in BTC or GME is extremely risky and many people have lost a lot of money doing so, but that does not mean adults should be criticized for choosing to invest and discussing that investment on a public forum. If people were not allowed to do so then BTC would still only be used to buy drugs over the dark net and it never would have even come close to its current price.",t3_m6bm55,2021-03-17 06:32:20,2021-03-17

If you can print more, build more, mine more or get more by whatever mechanism it is much worse bubble ... So i don't get this bubble FUD, every other asset is much worse bubble.

They just don't get it - every asset works that way, if there are more buyers = price goes up, if there are more sellers = price go down and it can crash a bit. You have to take out someone's money to withdraw from every market and if someone has too much or demand shrinks it can be crashed. Every asset is that way, but in every other asset you can print more on top of it to break it and crash it even more.... if BTC is a bubble and you cannot print more it is still 100 times better than everything else because you can ""print"" more of everything else.

Also no utility FUD is cool, if you want currency or store of value it is pretty stupid if it has any other utility because then you cannot utilize it just because it is artifically expensive like houses or gold. Young people have nowhere to live and electronics cannot use better conductor because houses and gold are stores of value with utility. It just prevents human race from living better lifes...
