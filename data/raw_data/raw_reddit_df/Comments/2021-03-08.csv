Essentially you are asking if the price will be higher or lower at a certain date. The answer is: no one knows. The aggregated opinion of redditors doesn't have any meaning either. So you won't get any smarter from asking such questions.  

In general, as they say: ""time in the market beats timing the market"". If you are buying for long term holding, the timing doesn't matter that much (because future prices are unpredictable, especially short term).

Mining is the task of entering new transactions into bitcoin's database. By doing so, miners facilitate bitcoin being send between the users of the network. But to avoid mischief and cheating, this task requires the miners to perform certain work (Proof Of Work). Because otherwise it would be too cheap to attack the network (if attacks are free and cheap, you can assume that somebody will try at some point).  

To incentivize this work, miners get paid in newly created bitcoin and the transaction fees which the users attach to their transactions.",t3_m09czb,2021-03-08 19:16:10,2021-03-08

78,gq7am5c,t1_gq77wy4,"> Any recommendations on any hardware wallets in particular? Does it even matter?

Yes, of course it matters. Hardware wallets are much safer in general (although usually the weakest link is the user, not the wallet itself).  

Having a hardware wallet from a reputable(!) brand is much better than having no hardware wallet at all. Coldcard, Trezor, Bitbox and Ledger are all reputable brands, but each with certain trade offs. If you don't have time to research, you basically can pick any from those randomly and it'll be better than a software wallet. I guess in general the recommendation would be for Coldcard, but it might be a bit less user friendly than the other options.

On the other hand, if regulations are too restrictive, they hurt users more than they help them, so it's always a double edged sword.  

I wouldn't say I am scared of regulations. Bitcoin on the network level cannot be regulated anyway (it already is regulated by the network itself). Of course there can be bans or other restrictions, but bitcoin should be functioning very robustly as a black market money, so extensive regulations is not something that might kill/hurt bitcoin",t3_m09czb,2021-03-08 22:00:49,2021-03-08

88,gq7pooa,t1_gq7jygx,"One argument I don’t hear bitcoiners make is that if the state passed regulations controlling the amount of energy used to mine bitcoin, or force miners to use green/renewable sources, the energy consumption would be reduced. The network would function and block times would remain the same because of the difficulty adjustment.

This, of course, is a libertarian nightmare, but if you’re going to appeal to people who trust the state to pass regulations to avoid a tragedy of the commons, we should point out that Bitcoin actually handles this scenario just fine. 

This is not desirable from a technical point of view, since reduced power consumption by the miners reduces network security. The key concept is you can’t get something from nothing. A military has to back the dollar, miners provide security for bitcoin via a wall of energy. But... if we all agreed to limit our consumption of energy used for mining, an idealistic but possible scenario, energy use would not be a problem... there’s nothing that says Bitcoin mining requires that amount of energy as it functions the same way today as it did when only a single computer (Santoshi’s) mined the genesis block.

Research difficulty adjustment, and then open up the conversation about the game theory of that. Discuss the tragedy of the commons and how to achieve global worldwide consensus. It’s a hard problem. I suggest pointing out that instead of reducing energy use, maybe we should focus on making our energy generation more green, more renewable.

1405,gq7owwz,t3_m0fucp,"The infrastructure has not sprouted up enough around the lightning network for BTC adoption to be ""imminent.""

Most people in the USA live paycheck to paycheck, never mind the rest of the world.  My point in this is... if a massive amount of people were to suddenly switch over to BTC, their transactions would never get confirmed and they wouldn't be able to buy anything.  The network would be choked out and people would be emotionally losing their shit all over the place.  And even that aside, most people can't afford to buy Bitcoin and just sit on it.

Bitcoin is well on its way to scaling, *I think*, but it currently does not.  People can say lightning all day long, and that's true, but at this rate it's going to be many more years before people adopt it and it's easy af for your everyday commoner to use.  Until the LN is pervasive enough to the point that everyday people can download an app on their phone and get virtually instant confirmations *AND THIS INFORMATION IS WIDESPREAD KNOWN BY COMMONERS*, BTC adoption is not ""imminent.""

I say this is as a full supporter, and not intentionally spreading FUD.  We will get there, but we are not there yet.

We need more time for lightning infrastructure and other second layer if not custodial solutions to improve such as widespread adoption by exchanges and improved apps... and more time for people to become educated.",t3_m0fucp,2021-03-08 22:33:54,2021-03-08

That’s the beauty of a sailing boat, you can build them in such a way that (depending on how much work you want to put in) you can move with the wind, yet generate lots of power with solar and wind generators. You can build hugely powerful lithium battery banks for a reasonable amount of money by buying cells directly from the manufacturer and constructing the system DIY simply by watching YouTube videos, you don’t need to be particularly capable, there’s plenty of walk through videos available that even a dumb ass like me can follow along to (well, the boat hasn’t burned down yet).

You can have as much or as little in the way of mod cons as you like. We have a fridge, two freezers (one larger power consuming chest freezer for the fish we catch) TV, stereo, electric autopilot, all the navigational equipment a boat needs. We’re in the middle of getting rid of all of our gas cooking systems and going full electric (helped by a huge battery bank and inverter) and the plan is to be as self sufficient as we possibly can be, moving around and exploring the world.

It’s not for everyone as lifestyles go, but, it brings the world to life in a way that just landing somewhere on a plane simply doesn’t. The people you interact with, the language barriers you have to overcome, the cultures you mix with are all richer when you arrive to remote places by sea. Everyone’s always so excited to see you, I wish I had done it 20yrs earlier and perhaps I would have been less infected by the tribal political BS that I and many of my friends and family couldn’t help but get caught up in.

The improvements of these others coins haven't been significant enough to motivate people to consider another coin besides bitcoin in the way that bitcoin made people consider another option besides USD.

You dont just need new improvements. You also need confidence. People need to believe in the investment. At this point bitcoin works, improves upon USD, and people have confidence in it. Convincing people to try some new coin is going to be hard unless it has an extremely different value proposition, like how btc was very different from usd. This new coin is going to have to be very different from btc and usd to motivate enough people to take a chance on it for it to get a foothold and gain some modicum of relevance. Right now, theres just nothing there. Bitcoin solves too many problems well enough that people dont have motivation for what they perceive as minor modifications slightly different value propositions with much, much higher risk and 0 track record compared to bitcoin.

Yes, something will likely come along eventually- but I think the thing you need to realize is the statistical odds that you will pick it are like 1/1000. You'll have to research each coin, experiment with it, understand what it brings to the table, and then decide if its worth your time or not. You would have to go through the code looking for oversights and problems that could be exploited and cause serious problems. The thing with bitcoin is because it's so big, theres a lot of people looking at the code already. And new coins are being created all the time. It would be a full time job. And then some coin you aren't educated on may take off and become the next bitcoin. It could happen.

Another thing is we dont know when its going to happen. it could be 5 years, it could take 50 years, it could take 100 years.
It took a lot to get to this point where so many people have invested in bitcoin that it has something that almost seems to resemble a modicum of stability and society generally seems to trust it. I think the idea that you could anticipate what the next bitcoin is is hubris. It sounds simple enough, but in practice its just not really something that can be predicted.

Right now (and this could change) I feel more confident in btc rising by a high amount compared to the stock market over the next 30 years than in my ability to anticipate what the next coin could be.

Sure theres going to eventually be a new coin. Theres always a new coin. USD was the new coin, now it looks like btc is the new coin. It stands to reason that there will be another coin one day and another after that. and so on and so forth. But its an almost obvious and irrelevant fact. Just cause we know something better will come one day, that doesn't really directly give us any obvious actionable thing to do. Its good to humble yourself by acknowledging that something better will come, but its also important not to let that make you feel defeated and stop you from acting on what makes sense today. One day something new will come and we will cross that bridge when we come to it. But nothing today stands out like bitcoin stood out in 2008.

2274,gq7de0m,t1_gq7ajbl,"Disclaimer: First off, I intend to always pay my taxes, and I don't want to encourage anyone to avoid paying them. But let's continue discussing how this could be done, so it can be fixed in the future.

I'm also pretty new into this, so I may have some wrong assumptions.

My answer:

Ah sure, but when you say you lost your wallets you also say you don't remember the address number. This is expected, no one remembers their bank account number for example. Therefore they can't track anything. And if they ask you where you had the address number saved, you say you lost that document too (that's another reason to justify you lost access).

But then you magically find one of the addresses (which is in fact a new address that you put the coins you want to cash out in it).

Then, it's after you cash out that you declare the number. And sure, they can check what happened there and will only see a bunch of ins and outs from other addresses that you say they aren't yours (but some of them, in fact, are). And this is further complicated if you only use 1 address per transaction, [as recommended](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/46401/how-or-why-a-bitcoin-address-is-a-single-use-token).

Essentially you have only declared a part of your coins, the ones you cashed out, and pay taxes on those. You will never escape some taxes, but you can hide others.

When you want to cash out again you do it from new addresses again.

The only solution to this would be to enforce declaring the address number to a person's ID, like how real banks ask for your ID when you open an account. That would require changing Bitcoin code, or centralising (which goes against Bitcoin purpose).

For now people can create addresses that aren't tied to anyone's documents that identify the owner.",t3_lzzmlm,2021-03-08 20:45:35,2021-03-08

I almost did to try to make an nft and try to make a couple bucks by selling an image. But then I saw I had to pay a fee to even post my item for sale. And it was in ETH (and I have no eth) which I guess I can’t be mad about. The fee (“gas” iirc) on opensea was like $50! On some other platform, rarible I think, the fee was like $7. Even 7 was too much for me cause I do worry that it’s a bubble anyway and I don’t want to lose even $7 and I don’t necessarily want to support the cause for eth by buying it cause I still don’t really believe in it. and I just decided I’m not posting my image, and moved on. But eth does intrigue me mildly, and a lot of smart people I know seem interested in it, my own biological brother included. And he’s technologically inclined. But he told me he tried to experiment with smart contracts, and he told me the fees were incredibly high and that this was making it difficult for him to experiment and even gain some deeper understanding (through experimentation)


For now all I have is btc. I’ve considered monero, I’ve had trusted people tell me to get comp and amp and filecoin and conflux, now I’m hearing algorand, I keep hearing people talk about cardano.. I really don’t know. It’s hard. Maybe even if I just put 10% in each I would’ve out performed btc, maybe not (I never checked), but also to me in my mind, at a random point in the future, no one knows when, most of these coins will go to 0. 

And I also think, in a similar way, people just need to buy btc, and not try to wait for dips or time the market, because no one knows when the next big rise will be, so you just have to buy it and hold it so you’re holding during the next big upward movement. At some random point in the future, it will rise. 

And even as I write this I question my own bias, I see how it sounds like this is a convenient belief for me to have, cause it means I get to be lazy and not have to adjust my investments. I really don’t know. This is my belief. I really do somewhat understand the grievances of people who dislike bitcoin and favor Alt coins. Especially slow transactions for example, I recognize the frustration a slow transaction can create. And I see the appeal in wishing btc was just faster. But people seem to be unable to make btc faster without compromising on something else. I really believe the people doing this are smart and while a certain coin may provide higher returns that btc (sort of like investing in a penny stock EV company instead of Tesla), I really believe, when it comes to the BTC space, it’s really very hard to predict the next BTC and I don’t feel equipped to do it. I keep finding myself asking if I really found a gem, or if I just am getting greedy and deluding myself in to thinking I found a better opportunity when in reality I’ve bought a lottery ticket,

A year or two ago I briefly held litecoin then sold and I just had a moment like ok, so if someone can just copy bitcoin and make a slight alteration and call it litecoin....

Then is that destined to continue? Should we expect another light coin soon? Another copy of btc with a slight variation? And is that inflation, then? If we just keep creating new cryptos, is that similar to the fed printing money? Idk. And regardless, of course, whether it’s inflation or not I still want to make money if there’s money to be made but for now I’m still the stubborn old man shaking his fist on his lawn. 

Maybe I’m dumb, maybe I have hubris, but to me, when everyone said bitcoin was a bubble I disagreed. 

Now everyone is saying crypto is the future, and I’m trying to say, basically, all crypto except bitcoin is a bubble.",t3_lzzmlm,2021-03-08 15:17:40,2021-03-08

There is a problem here, that your ""lost address"" is going to have a transaction in it from this year, but you said you lost the details of all the accounts x years ago. So you would need to ensure that you had pre-split all the BTC into many accounts before you ""lose"" access.

I would pull money out, but then when I needed to make a big purchase or send the IRS a big check, I'd make a big cash deposit. So, _clean money_ was moving back and forth.

One day I pulled out $14k cash which the staff at the local branch made no issue with.

They’re pretty widespread where I live, so it fixes it for me. I figure they’re probably widespread in a place with local Suntrust Bank branches too but sure, maybe not. Maybe Bitcoin doesn’t solve this issue for every single person on the planet today. You got me there.

No, I’m not trying hard at all. Bitcoin would likely offer this person and many others experiencing a similar issue legitimate protection.

The original painting is sold, and waiting to  be sent to its new owner, which is amazing, and was made possible by the overwhelming support I received here.  
I didn't NFT it because of some personnal convictions regarding intellectual property. I'd much rather have you all use it as you wish, so here it is. I hope that the quality will be enough to print posters out of it, if anyone wants to.   
And if anyone is crazy enough to try and make commercial use of it (selling posters or whatever), I don't mind. At all. In fact, send me a link !",t3_lzu3oa,2021-03-08 00:40:30,2021-03-08

It is a massively profitable industry, and I could see this digital ownership in games moving to a blockchain, so then those skins/items could be owned forever and easily transferred between them.

A lost key means a loss of $1.5bn. But if you have too many backups that are too accessible, it’s a theft risk.

Ultimately, I assume they must be held in a wallet on a laptop just like the rest of us.

But how to solve these issues for a decentralized database was unknown until bitcoin. Time is subjective globally and to solve the double spend problem you need a decentralized time server.

The pow system in bitcoin... It's effectively a decentralized time server to order blocks.

The WP they talks about the security model designed to make this system more secure as more users participate in it and discribes the structure of the blockchain

Yes i too have seen a very superficial understanding of the WP.

 Eg in bcash community even it's developers don't understand why finalizing blocks after a depth of 11 is a fundamental violation of the WP. Then they have the nerve to say they are the real bitcoin lol..",t3_m06q56,2021-03-08 14:39:34,2021-03-08
