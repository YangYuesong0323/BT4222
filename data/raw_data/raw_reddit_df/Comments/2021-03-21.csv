I have a question and my only chance before trying it is going to be from a kind soul. 

I have 1k usd in btc at 42k for the long term. 

I want to swing trade if you will another 1k. 

I know that it will average me up to buy more around current 55k or so. 

If I jot down the exact fractional amount of btc I bought with my new 1k and sell it at peaks. Will that return my average back to where it was.

Also how will my application know which bitcoin to sell...my 42k btc or my 55k btc. 

Should I just do it through a new application.

The Sunday dumps are harder (not more just harder) because the pools use the lack of buy power on weekends. They dump on the markets and short along to maximise sell pressure and gain more.

What does that even mean? That only 1% of humanity holds any amount of bitcoin? Is that an estimate of yours? Even if that's the case, the price to own bitcoin is simply the cost of the first transaction and won't necessarily be higher.

> It is convenient to look at these statistics here.

The estimated growth of population there seems to be off by at least a factor 3. See [here](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) for a more accurate estimate.

> the amount of bitcoin per person will decrease every day

False. In the past year the bitcoin supply grew more than 2% while the world population grew less than 1%.

> And you will become richer.

False, even if the previous one was true. You will only become richer if bitcoin keeps increasing in price.

> Bitcoin has become the third currency in the world

For exactly no reason, you are comparing all bitcoin with a minuscule, selected amount of currency, as if 100 EUR on my bank account weren't as real as the 100 EUR note in my pocket. If you account for all money, that's false by more than an order of magnitude, as already pointed out many times even on this sub. [It's currently 14th](https://fiatmarketcap.com/), behind even the Swiss Franc and the Brazilian Real.

So I think the the best game plan is dollar cost average always regardless of price. Because if the price is high you’ll want to wait, if it’s low you will want to hold out for it to drop more.  Steady DCA and if you see a really convincing dip/bear market throw some extra at it. My buy this morning was really just my DCA that I had been lagging on doing...

The important thing is to be realistic. Invest only what you can afford to lose. A lot of people obviously dream of becoming Bitcoin millionaires, and that would be nice and all, but it's still just as important to focus on your life, your personal finances, get your basic finances in order, etc. I can use big banks at the same time I invest in Bitcoin.

Just because there were earlier times to buy doesn't negate that. The opinion is predicated on the idea that Bitcoin has a long, long way to go. By your logic, anyone who recently bought in could never say they were early. But in reality, looking back, they were. That's the point of the post. It's dumb to reduce it to some method of ""latecomers comforting themselves"" when the OP is providing an actual case and all you've said is ""Bitcoin rose a lot so therefore it's not early.""
