I've also learned over the years if Warren Buffet is telling you something is a bad bet/investment, it's generally a great idea to buy what he's telling you to avoid. Old rich people didn't get rich by doing what they tell the peasants to do, it's rules for thee not for me etc. They have such a gatekeeping culture of trying to keep people from hitting their wealth level unless they go through the proper crony networking channels and are part of the elite culture that jerks each other off.

I haven‚Äôt really seen any solid use case except for transferring of money anonymously, internationally and without banking involved. It is smart, yes, I‚Äôve used it myself to buy shitloads of drugs, way before most people here even knew about Bitcoin, but it will not replace fiat any time soon. Crypto daily trading volume is still less than 5% of fiat currencies, probably even less. 

All I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a bit funny, y‚Äôall are celebrating it going up, but does that make it more useful?  Not really, only means more people adopted it.

Isn't that up to the individual to decide? That is a cop-out excuse, in my opinion. If people choose to use payment method alternative to BTC, that costs Valve nothing and  affects nothing. For those who DO choose to pay with BTC (not every game costs $5 by the way), that would be what they HODL.

The support tickets, maybe I can see. But really if you are using BTC to make payments you should have done your research at this point and understand that, yes, there are fees associated with BTC. Again, this is a cop-out, but from a headache standpoint, makes more sense than your first point.

The real issue I could see would be returns. BTC payments are non-reversible and, for example, games like No Mans Sky or CyberPunk where half the people who bought it returned it... that would definitely be a problem for Valve.
