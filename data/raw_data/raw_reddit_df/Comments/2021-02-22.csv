3134,goc9xgn,t1_goc69em,"what hes saying is wait until the price rebounds a little bit before you go buying if your buying 100%s on a red bar youre fucking up.   Buy in 10,20,30%'s on the way down or 100% if you feel comfortable youve found the line of support to where it will rebound upwards beyond your new entry point.  Buying on a freefall can royally fuck you if you pull the trigger too early thinking ""ah yes, this cant go much longer"".... persoanlly i would set my charting to 1hr candles and find support from there... looks like the lst decent support is at 50k, maybe 52.5 if youre optimistic.  I wouldnt personally buy back in until i saw an hr or 2 worth of rebounds around the 50k mark.  I AM dumb tho so, dont listen to me",t3_lpn1kx,2021-02-22 22:04:39,2021-02-22

4162,goc5xhj,t1_goc33f4,"Fuck man, that's rough. I hope the divorce goes smoothly and she doesn't try to use your daughter as a bargaining chip. Try not to let anger overwhelm you, betrayal like this can turn people into monsters. I've known a couple that separated after one of them cheated and the court battles are still ongoing, 4 years and tens of thousands of euros later. It truly brings out the worst in people. Worst part is their kids are caught in the middle of it all, innocent souls too young to understand what's going on and they're being constantly manipulated and told lies. It's really sad to see.

Good luck, stay strong. Time will dull the hurt and you *will* find someone worthy of your trust.",t3_lpiot9,2021-02-22 21:24:44,2021-02-22
