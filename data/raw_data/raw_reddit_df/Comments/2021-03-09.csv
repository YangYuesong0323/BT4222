I think my advice would be to start calling different lenders and ask if they would be okay with sourcing money from a crypto deposit. Freddie and Fannie say you can do it as long as it was deposited into a us bank and you can document the purchase and sale. That process likely won't be easy for you or the lender especially if you bought lots of small buys over time. The only sort of document I could get from cash app showing my buys was a CSV which is hardly official. You'd probably have to use that along with all your bank statements matching up to the buys from the CSV. Who knows. 
Seems the easiest way is to let the crypto sit in your checking for so that two full months statements don't show it and try that route. Best of luck!",t3_m0v2pe,2021-03-09 21:32:42,2021-03-09

This is the 4th home purchase of my life, each one an upgrade from the previous, but my share of my first down payment that made it all possible was made by a modest inheritance from my grandmother‚Äôs estate. 

My adult kids will inherit this home plus a vacation home (paid off) plus my annuity plus anything left in my retirement when I die. They also had the benefit of not needing to take student loans. This puts them financially ahead of many of their cohort. 

Meantime, the spouse and I have one elderly parent each, living in their homes. It may still be many years yet, but our inheritance will be our share of those homes and the associated estates. It will be significantly more than we need to pay off ours early and renovate it, and ensure that our retirement accounts will be flush. Probably with some left over to help our kids with their own down payments.

I do not think that this issue is any important in the digital world: The vast majority of wallets have the unit system as a user's preference. Say, my wallet uses that odd-preference-by-many-here ""bits"", and yours uses ""tonal bitcoins"" (a cool choice), we can transact with each other just fine as our wallets translate and convert the units in payment requests neatly behind the scene. The same is true if we use other scales of measure, like fiat equivalents such as dong or eurocents. 

Furthermore, that does not look like enough of a justification for a controlled monetary policy. Etherium's centrally planned monetary policy is expressly tailored for block-producers' sufficient subsidy, this is, chain security incentives and low fees (lol, yes, lol), but **not unit stability**. ETH will never be more stable than BTC, and in fact it has always been much more volatile (at times, as much as thrice as volatile).

> Deflationary money, is money no one wants to spend. No money spent, economy doesn't run anymore

But this is quickly debunked. Just look at the prices of practically all of electronics and computer stuff. They only go down and down, very quickly and very consistently, yet they are still consumed massively.

> the story about a single crypto, is the same talk as those saying one religion, or one language, or one search engine

If the reference for the degree of convergence are *language* and *search engine*, I think we are quite safe by going all in into Bitcoin and rejecting everything else ;)

I think I get what you mean though: Cultural traits do not necessarily converge to a single one, not even under a strong influence of globalisation. I reject this view: Bitcoin is not an identity. We all like to talk at times in terms of zealotry, allegiance and maximalism (a term coined by Vitalik essentially to try to justify his pre-mined scam), but this is all just for the memes, not a real, genuine belief.

There is no need to look at culture as a reference, when we can take other examples of money itself as the reference. In the fiat world, we pretty much converged to the US dollar (see the petrodollar, the eurodollar, dollarisation, reserve currency status, etc.), even when legal tender laws work against this in most of the world. In the precious-metal world, we converged to gold; bimetallism was at times forced by law but it ultimately failed, even when physical constraints tend to favour it massively, at least for the case of silver.

So, in the cryptocurrency world, where none of those conditionings apply, a convergence to Bitcoin seems like it can be even much quicker and natural.",t3_m0pspg,2021-03-09 16:40:50,2021-03-09

Stocks are widely recognized to be overvalued and the market filled with ""zombie companies"" due to the pandemic.

2871,gqbwemr,t1_gqaoqw2,"I wholly agree with you. I've been having a few mind-blown moments about why the rich stay rich and the poor get poorer, and I REALLY want Bitcoin to fix this.

Governments provided a means of money for its citizens and the financially smart realised that they should diversify their wealth into assets. The problem is that our system/community/whatever teaches us that money is our means of exchange and our means of preserving wealth; ""save money in the bank"".

We are also taught that diversifying into assets and financial products that the wealthy created for the purpose of preserving their wealth is risky and that money is our baseline. As we get a bit wiser, we learn that money is tied to our economy and that inflation is natural. We don't really think too hard about how when we work extra hard to save for our future, the value of our work diminishes over time, we are running against a steep upwards hill.

We are told that investing is as bad as gambling, yet we are allowed to gamble our money away just fine. This incentivises actual gambling over getting a foot into the investing world where we can make calculated decisions.

Yet, the biggest kicker is... we shouldn't need to be financial experts to preserve our wealth. Our kids get smarter every generation, and yet they are driven out and away from their families every generation. They move to cheaper locations because they can't afford to live near their families, because we get poorer every generation.

Bitcoin is for everyone and anyone. If you want to risk your house, and everything you own against Bitcoin, do it. You might not get what you want, but you will come away having learnt from your mistakes. 

My advice is to practice caution, but some people don't have the luxury to do that; yet they are being taken advantage of if they don't do anything... 

Risk causing yourself harm, or guarantee harm from your country? Let's not manipulate our poorer neighbours either way. Let's not push too hard into getting the word out, as we will come across preachy and scammy and we'll probably help some scammers out there too. But let's also not gatekeep this space for those who have disposable income. Don't forget that Bitcoin isn't always more risky than the situation that they are currently in.

FIAT is NOT the baseline.

Find the dates of the prior halvings.  Look at the long term price chart, logarithmic view (try the BLX ticker on Tradingview).  Match them up.  There's a clear pattern.

Seriously, do your research and be safe.  It would be really bad if you lost 80% of your investment value right before your wedding.",t3_m0q6w2,2021-03-09 06:47:36,2021-03-09

3032,gqaoqwk,t1_gqao2wl,"So what does it mean for someone who's planning between 1-5 years out?  That's a good question.

We're clearly in a bull market now.  If the past 3 halvings are any guide, that will end sometime within (very likely) a year from now, and we'll see a significant bear market after that.  That means if you're planning to pay for an event, like OP, 2 years from now, it would be very prudent to lock in some profits at some point during this next year.  Maybe don't sell it all, but when the market gets really frothy and you feel extra greedy and you're sure you're gonna be a millionaire any moment, it's probably time to sell 5 or 10%.  Then keep doing that until you at least have enough cash on hand to pay for whatever you need to pay for.  You take what's called a ""risk off"" or ""defensive"" posture relative to the market.

Most people time the market horribly.  We're programmed that way.  When everyone is fearful and you think an asset is dead, as long as the fundamentals are good, you need to be buying, not ignoring the market or worse, selling.  When everyone is mad greedy and mortaging their houses to buy something because it can only go up (like Bitcoin in late 2017), chances are it's time to start selling.  Do the opposite of what your emotions tell you.  But mostly, play it smart and keep your time horizon in mind.  The more you make as you approach your target event, the more profit you want to lock in, so you don't lose it.",t3_m0q6w2,2021-03-09 13:00:18,2021-03-09

3034,gqau2wz,t1_gqasshm,"Yup.  The trick is to not sell too early.  Let that kind of mania build.  Then when it begins to break, start shaving some off.  You'll almost certainly not sell the top, but you'll almost certainly get to buy back lower if you're patient.

Then when the bears get cocky and start calling for completely ridiculous drawdowns and everyone is paying attention to something else...get the hell back in.",t3_m0q6w2,2021-03-09 14:04:10,2021-03-09
