0,gtg2v7w,t3_mke62a,"Where do network fees go to? (I assume miners)

With BTC mining rewards halving every 4 years, how will there be any incentive for miners left? Electricity costs etc. will be high for a relatively low comparable reward.

Also, if the mining costs outweigh the mining rewards consensually (e.g. electricity prices surging everywhere, scenario above), how do you see BTC maintaining its value? Wouldn't it simply become a stale asset, bound to devalue?

Unlikely, as one bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 parts (satoshis), and can be made divisible further, if really necessary (although this probably would need a hardfork).

BTC has a double bottom on the 1H chart. And very close to same on 2, 3 and 4H. 

Everybody waiting for a **dip** just missed it. Either temporarily or for a long long time. I can‚Äôt tell because I‚Äôm not a crystal ball. 

Either buy Bitcoin or set a target and stick to it.  Quit waiting for some nebulous **dip**. 

Bitcoin has been to 57k twice now in 48 hours and bounced off that line. You have missed out. So buy or wait and cross your fingers. Whilst being firmly aware that Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt seen below 50k for almost 3-4 weeks now and the average price has been rising day by day.

The average price has been going higher and higher slowly. So waiting for a **dip** is beginning to look idiotic.
Because there have been 10-20 **dips** in the last 4 weeks. So if you can‚Äôt buy them you‚Äôre just being an idiot or extremely hypocritical.

I had some BTC in Jan at the ATH at 40. And I kept buying every 2/3k down as that was my plan. At 28k still bought more. I‚Äôm up 100% on some of that. Yet I remember reading on here that same stuff **yeah I‚Äôm wait until it dips to 20** yeah. How‚Äôd that work out?

The March low was 43k and we haven‚Äôt seen that in a long time now. In fact we haven‚Äôt even seen under 50 for a full month almost. 

Waiting on waiting on waiting for small pennies is idiotic. I bought dips every few K from 40 on down and I‚Äôve already 100x my money in some cases. 
Meanwhile we‚Äôve still got Johnny Big Brain waiting for more dips. Despite having all of March and even now to do it.",t3_mkd81b,2021-04-05 19:26:19,2021-04-05

Before I take the picture I sold a drum set, some guitar amps, cymbals being the most lucrative. I‚Äôm not a musician but 5 years ago I use to make live shows at my house for local bands, so that stuff have been collecting dust and rust all this time and it make me happy that some musicians got a hold of this thing for cheap. Also I make good money selling the spots for other people to sell and I going to this every month and I‚Äôm sure I will sell more spots for the next one. 

About the ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight Returns‚Äù
It‚Äôs not useless, but I already read it and I‚Äôm keeping another comics that are most likely I will want to re-read in the future. I much prefer that someone else have the opportunity to read it for first time than have to clean the dust from time to time, and I feel the same with videogames. At the end of the day it was difficult to sell it because it‚Äôs in english, hope to sell it next month you don‚Äôt find this stuff in the stores in my area.

About the ‚ÄúF40‚Äù
If I don‚Äôt sell it my 4 year old will beak it, she already broke a Dogde Viper, a Ferrari 455GT, and a beautiful Ferrari GTB4 that was red is now blue. I let her keep a Porsche Carrera and a Corvette C5 that still are in good shape. Yesterday I sold the ‚ÄúF50‚Äù to a lady that have not clue what was buying, that hurt a little. 

Disclaimer:
I‚Äôm not the DJ, it‚Äôs a friend that volunteered because he said it was better than staying a home. Also we talk about Bitcoin obviously.

If you don't care when you get it (because you know you'll get it once the transaction has been posted), use just enough money to get the transaction picked up eventually (>1.5 sat/vB).  You don't need to worry about double spend because most consumer wallets prevent you from doing so anyway.

Now, if you were trying to sell something like a car, a phone, console, any sort of easily transportable (stealable) equipment, I'd ask for a next-block transaction.

e.g.  I'm having a garage sale and theres a shirt someone wants to buy from me.  I'll say, sure for 5$.  Once they scan and make the transaction, just show it to me, and you can have the shirt.  I don't care when that 5$ hits my wallet, because I know it will hit eventually.",t3_mkc0vp,2021-04-05 22:01:43,2021-04-05

You can also always use RBF to set a higher fee for your unconfirmed transactions.

The fact that the bitcoin fee market is a free market is, in fact, a positive rather than a negative.

Skimming it, I think the main issue is that the first few tiny payments you receive in a channel are not really worth much as if you would close that channel it would result in dust on chain, which is not economical to spend anymore.

As I understand it, I would say that as soon as the balance on your side of the channel gets above the dust limit, then any additional satoshi simply adds up to the existing non-dust output and would therefore be fine.

So, naively, I'd say the solution is just making sure you always have a non-dust amount on your side of the channel (so open it like that or immediately after opening it, make a significant transfer in or out of your channel using another channel). That is, if you care about losing a few satoshi's in the first place, as that chance is probably still fairly low as whoever is attacking you, is losing even more money.",t3_mkc0vp,2021-04-05 19:38:41,2021-04-05

2229,gtgbzus,t3_mjwhag,"I may result in ""the bad one"", but man, I born here, and I can tell you that this is a shit hole of a country. As soon as you start to live here, you will notice this.

yes people are kind, but the system is structured to punish the one that want to be modern, changes are not allowed, low pays and increasing costs since 20 years, politics is a joke, since they don't let 1 gov to finish his job, but they interrupt and break down every single government.

Most problematic thing is : you will not be rewarded based on your work. You even get more taxation if you work extra hours at work, so as I told you, the system is structured to let everyone ""poor"" in the same situation as the others.

Workers asks for too many protections, that's why the cost of a single unity worker cost so much now, and business are closing and moving to cheaper countries.

All this if you are lucky to find a job, since if you are not Italian, you are already discriminated, ugly? also another discrimination, since they ask a picture in the CV, so they base the recruitment also on beauty aspect. Funny this about the interviews : if you have studied to much like university and such, they are going to tell you that you are to much ""studied"" or ""prepared"" to be get this ""simple"" job.

After this, the average pay is 1500 MAX (in the richer north, south the average is 1200 if lucky, or 900 as normal) apartment is usually around 300-600 depends is you get a single room, or a 2bed flat, then food is 50-100/week so lets say 200/month, then you have bills, at least 150-200 for everything like water/gas/garbage/tv/internet/electricity every month.

This are the basic one, let's assume 1300-500-200-200=400,

Remove bus tickets, cloths, vehicle + insurance + biannual revision + possession tax + petrol 1.5‚Ç¨/L (CRAZY HIGH) , mobile phone, and other things, you will need, 400 become 200 if lucky, then what? You live here, work and survive only?

This country is a mess, in many aspects, old thinking, still believing ""this is the best country"" AHAHAHAHAH

Yes, the only good thing for immigrant is that this hole allow them to get documents, and work here, where if they try to go in Germany or other countries, they get a direct NO, unless they have wars in home country. here we allow everyone to enter illegally, and then we give them food, clothes, phone, internet, some pocket money, a place to eat and sleep and many other things, that aggravate the already bad public balance.

This to say that this country have no sense in all of this, since they help the immigrant more than the natives, nothing wrong in helping others, but AFTER you made sure that you own freaking people can live a decent life. But hey, we don't care...

Also you will ask ok, the paychecks are low, but everything is fine, public health care, good streets and maintenance, efficient bureaucracy, fair police, good schools, no corruption in every government part, and many other things, well... How to say this... EVERY SINGLE THING I SAID HERE IS WRONG AND BAD, THE OPPOSITE.... And people seems ok with this, as soon as you give them the tv series, the last phone, food and the freedom to go out and waste their time and life.

want a list? ok

1. Public health care have months on waiting lists, when you go in the  Emergency room you can end up there for hours with a broken arm, or many other things, and no, this is not ""only now cause the covid"" but is like this since I can remember it. The structures are yellow inside, old, bad smells, dirty, 4 patients in 1 room if not 6, old instruments, bad food, and they ""forget"" to feed patients, they mistake the medicine, bad operations at the point that some hospitals have the  fame  of a very bad place, since they do all of this mistakes in many hospitals. ""free health care""......
2. Good streets? AHAHAHHAHA there is nothing like the streets in Italy, come and try, in the north the situation is ""better"" but below that, Jesus save your shock absorbers, you will need to change them regularly, since the streets are made with a shitty job, to pay less, and save on materials.... They broke every year in the winter, since the rain penetrate down, and break the asphalt from inside. then they come to cover it (only after the hole become like a volcano) then they cover it again with a light layer of asphalt (if lucky) only to see the street full of this patches that will lead to bumps and more problems as soon as it rain again. Actually they do patches only after it rained, or during a light rain, to save even more on materials, since it will inflate...... (a plus that only few notice is : They repair streets only if one important politician have to visit the city, so they plan the route, months before, then they start to work on that streets to look good at him, and to say ""look, we did a good job with your money, be king and give us more money and favors, we will use it to help the population ;)"" )
3. municipal offices are a joke here. You go to do 1 thing, so you ask them since on internet was nothing about it. They they say ""A. B C. go and come back when you have it."" 3 different other offices, then you go to A they ask for 2 pics and 1 photocopy, then B ask for the document that C have, then C ask for the recipe that A didn't give you, so you go back to A, then to C, then finally to B, only to know, after all the queue you had to get the recipe from C also, but to have it you have to wait another 3 days, since the office is now closed and work only in some mornings, then you wait, but after that, you have to get a new recipe from A, and finally go and finish all. This is only an example, more complexity is the daily basis.
4. Police also try to get as much money as they can from cars and drivers, instead of doing a proper ""safety"" job, giving people the peace, and peace of mind in law enforcement, the act like they are untouchable, like they are immune to the laws that regulate the normal people, in fact they feel above the justice, and they will use every tricks to fuck you, instead of helping you. You can also notice how they react when something happen, like a fire, an accident, or many other things, like you ask, ""good evening agent, I see so many police here, what happened? Is everyone fine or there are some wounded people over there?"" they reply in this lines : ""So please go ahead and don't stop, it's none of your business, and I don't have to tell you anything, so go away, don't make any problems or we should stop you too.""  If this is the way to reassure the population, and lead them to trust the police, maybe I'm stupid and I don't understand, but I think this is the wrong way. Being grumpy for no reason, and not responding to people's fears is the best way to be hated. On top of that many of them use drugs, cheat on tests, enter in police only because they want a revenge since they were bullied and so on.
5. Good schools, Many schools have fallen on the heads of students in Italy, due to poor maintenance, many of them are still the same since 60 years, many of them don't have any gym inside, the walls are all dirty, yellowish and broken.               Professors do we want to talk about it? Old for the most part, with a closed mind, and radical political positions that they express against students, acting as propaganda for such parties, and above all they don't like those who ask and actively intervene, but prefer and reward those who memorize the notions without even asking for the because of things. Espionage is encouraged, and students are not allowed to come together and all be a good group, but professors always tend to divide and rule. Above all, they bring their problems to school as unlucky and poor people, and then they pour out against the students, screaming, and acting partly like the police. Where those who have just a minimum of power over the citizens, pull it out and strut it as if it were a super power. --------------------------------Another fundamental point is the fact of not updating, notions stuck for 30 years, students forced to carry books with backpacks that weigh up to 20kg in the back instead of a simple tablet. Professors without inventiveness and parroting things over and over again. What is missing most of all is the total absence of practice in the lessons, relegating most of the time to theory, thus not even giving the students space to progress and develop the parts of the brain suitable for creation and entertainment, thus resulting boring, and students often sleep during the hours, because too much theory tires the brain and does not help it develop. In addition, students are given homework for many hours, so after having done 8 hours at school, you must also go home and do at least 3-4-5 hours of homework ..... This approach is old and harmful, as it takes away precious time and socialization from students, who can no longer devote themselves to anything else if they want to have a good evaluation according to the standards of the antiquated professors.
6. Last one is the corruption of the govs, well, this will lead me to write for DAYS, you can check on Internet about the level of corruption in this country.

I don't know from where are you from, but even capital gains are taxed at 26% and every trade is a taxable event, so imagine how they want you to become successful.

23% vat, lowest paychecks on EU and cost of living increasing is what this country is experiencing, and the population still think that ""we are the best country in the planet"". 

Well done, well done, come, and after some years, come here and tell me how it went for you, if it went well, I will be more than happy, but since I know this country, the % of success are low, super low.

Good luck btw peace and hodl crypto, my only opportunity as of now. Cheers.",t3_mjwhag,2021-04-05 21:50:46,2021-04-05

I'm so happy for you.

It's not too late to start stacking cryptos again.
You can keep buying them sats and altcoins again while waiting for the moon. Some folks list started doing that. Once again, you ain't late.

One Altcoin I can recommend is $BET.

With $BET, you can stake for dividends in Bitcoin & Ethereum every month [here](https://luck.earnbet.io). It's a fully Decentralised & Non-Custodial Casino where hodlers of their native token, $BET, enjoy numerous benefits as well as staking for monthly dividends.

PS: There's a Leaderboard Promo on the Casino which ends on 4/6/2021 where the Top 50 Players for the week get to share $2,000 worth of Bitcoin plus 10,000 $BET tokens.",t3_mjwhag,2021-04-05 04:30:50,2021-04-05

2412,gtei43q,t3_mjwhag,"Way to goo brother. This message  coming from an immigrant that came from another country  and now is in the process for a green card in the USA. The process was hard and long. People who aren't familiar with immigration and the wait of process that it takes even though you have all documents ready for the USCIS to review it takes years,  plus getting a interview and and sending more papers. I really wish the process could increase in efficiency in the future. If we want more immigrants to become legally in the USA. Lets make the process more user friendly and paperless with only communication instead of long time appointments. Anyways I don't think becoming legally im the USA could ever have a price so cheers brother on achieving another step. (ESL)English is my second language any input/constructive  comments are welcome.

2534,gtelym5,t1_gtcpmjc,"Basically you need every birth, marriage, and death cert from who was born in Italy, to you.  Documents not in Italian needs to be translated into it, and you'll need an apostille on most the documents, but that's just a special seal from the sec of state that issued said doc.

So, I've not answered anything you asked, huh?  LOL  Cost wise,  it varies.  OP hired a lawyer but you don't have to.  Say you you born in Iowa, your parents in Michigan, your grandparents from Jersey, and your great grandparents were from Italy.  You yourself can order each and every doc.  The comunes in Italy (think cities) will often respond to a physical letter or an email and send you the needed birth/marriage certs.  All the US ones, like $10-30 varying per state, translations can be had at about $20 a page, and the apostille is about $20ish a doc.  There will be more variables depending if you are applying via your grandparents or your great great grandparents.  More generations = more docs = more money.  Plus if people are alive, no death certs obviously.  Say you need 15 vital docs, 3 are from Italy and had for free, 12 from the US at about $60 each (for the doc, translation and apostille), so you're at $720, another I think its $75 for proof of when said immigrant naturalized in the US... $800ish maybe, but perhaps the comune in Italy never responded and you had to pay someone in Italy $200 to go knock on their door and get them for you.  Then there is a 300 euro application fee.  I think a lot wrap things up for about $1,500 or so.  Now the OP, they might have paid 2, 4 maybe 5K.  Why?  To order 15 vital docs via several states plus Italy, plus docs from the federal government... it takes time.  Some people are busy.  Some people don't want to deal with all the what, the how, etc and would rather just pay.  I was cheap.   I did it myself.",t3_mjwhag,2021-04-05 09:08:34,2021-04-05

The reason I had to hire a lawyer is because my grandad wasn‚Äôt registered when he was born. So I need to pay the lawyer to take everything to the judge to make a late birth certificate for him.
I have all the other documents including the birth certificate from Italy but still need to translate and fix the names and dates that were mistakenly written on different documents. 

Each document was around us$10 in Brazil, the one from Italy was free (I still don‚Äôt have it with me so I‚Äôll need to pay the shipping price), so far on I‚Äôve spent around $100 on these documents and the lawyer will cost me around $850 and I estimated that the translations and to fix the documents will cost me another $500 max. (This was my first ‚Äúmoon‚Äù)

Then I need to finally go to Europe! Flight, accommodation, food (for around 3-4 months until I get the ID) and a few other taxes that I‚Äôm taking in consideration will probably cost me $4000-$6000 (this my second ‚Äúmoon‚Äù)

But yeah, it really depends on each family and country you are.

2584,gtcpkd6,t1_gtcmti8,"Being an expat in Italy with no knowledge of Italian won't be easy, even if you are fluent in english, even more difficult if you are not fluent. I am talking based on experience. You won't have to worry about the ""permesso di soggiorno"", but there are many challenges to overcome before you will be settled. And my experience is from pre-Covid times so it might be even harder.

I am not writing to discourage you, but just know that it is not going to be easy especially if it is your first time moving from one country to another.

First thing is deciding where in Italy to move. North Italy can offer more jobs that have decent contracts, benefits and a reasonable pay. Luckily you will be paid in Euro that is less of a shitcoin than the argentinian currency. On the downside it is more expensive to live there if you are unemployed and looking for a job. Rent in Milan can easily reach 1500 per month for a small basic appartment. Same goes for most of the major cities. If you have a tight budget and you will be spending your savings while finding a job you are gonna be on a timer.

Assuming that you have a good education and you have a degree in a good field like engineering, medicine, science etc you will have to have that education certified as degrees or high school diplomas are not directly approved. If you are still getting an education it will be easier as, if you complete a master in italy, they will basically just take into consideration that your prior education was good enough to complete higher education in italy. With no degree is hard to get a good job unless you have a strong network and you can land a job through it. Very basic jobs do not pay so well, you can survive but not live the life.

I would add that trying to find a Job in italy while in Argentina is practically impossible. If you manage you are LUCKY AF.

With that said you have opportunities to move around Europe whith your italian passport and Spain has some problems aswell, but atleast you will be fluent in their native language. It is your choice of course.",t3_mjwhag,2021-04-04 23:03:57,2021-04-04

Thats why you will find plenty of companies in the Netherlands looking for english speaking people. In all companies in which I worked for in the Netherlands, all of them spoke just English. 
For sure there are several other countries in the EU which pushed forward similiar like England (RIP), Ireland (very good if you are looking for a good salary), France, Germany (especially Berlin is an international meltpot), even some Parts of Portugal/Spain/Austria/Belgium/Slovenia are very good for international expats.

The problem with Italy in this sector is that there are a lot of small and medium manufacturing companies that produce excellent products but are not able to switch from traditional operations to a more modern way of integrating in the supply chain.

They say that italian companies do not have CEO's but have OWNERS, usually some older guy who made their money in the economic boom of the 60's and 70's and does not really have an high education. People like this do not know the value of higher education or specializations, they just value work experience. Another sad thing.

2617,gtcw0fw,t1_gtctfzi,"Yeah the fastest way to boost credit your credit score is to increase your credit/debit ratio. I'd start from credit cards, assuming you have all of them payed in full. If you don't I would definitely sell BTC to do that as cc interests are downright criminal. That said, you can log in online on each cc as ask for a credit limit increase, which is usually approved or denied instantly.. it doesn't cost anything and doesn't hit your credit score.  
Then you can start paying off debt from the highest interest to the lowest. If the car loan is your only debt, paying off 75% of it will raise your score by a lot. If it's only a small part of your overall debt (mortgage? school loans?) it's only affecting the score by a few points and not worth wasting btc to pay off.",t3_mjwhag,2021-04-05 00:00:12,2021-04-05

2683,gtf1gxq,t1_gte897n,"I'm just speculating, but 30k never again seems possible with such crazy adoption.",t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 11:41:57,2021-04-05
2684,gtfcuhr,t1_gte897n,"Funny you say that. I said exactly the same thing to another person on Youtube a few days ago. I see it that way, too. That seems like logical price action.",t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 14:02:19,2021-04-05
2685,gtfzenb,t1_gtfnpcf,"The thing is, next drop could be from 160k to 90k.",t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 19:44:34,2021-04-05
2686,gtfak4x,t1_gtf1gxq,I wouldn't say never. It's possible for us to hit that when a crypto bear market comes. I do believe though it is unlikely (though not impossible) for us to go sub 20k in the next bear market as usually the previous market high in the previous cycle usually becomes the market floor.,t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 13:30:48,2021-04-05

We will reach 30k sooner than you think.",t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 12:53:01,2021-04-05

2689,gtg2zw3,t1_gtfzenb,Would you say even a small amount of money could turn out to be worth investing?,t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 20:24:46,2021-04-05
2690,gtf9sm4,t1_gtf7o88,"I'm speculating, but you're stating! I hope you're right, cause I'll be buying more! But who knows how high the floor will be post bull run dude.",t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 13:20:34,2021-04-05
2691,gtg96z6,t1_gtg2zw3,"Sure, if you have like 500$, just throw it in btc and move on with your life. This wont be life changing money even in 10 years but it might be nice boost to your budget. You might think about btc like savings account with high interest because its very likely the price will go up.",t3_mk10y6,2021-04-05 21:25:46,2021-04-05
