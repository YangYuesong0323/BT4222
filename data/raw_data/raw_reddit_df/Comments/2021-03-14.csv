2022,gqw7cnl,t1_gqw2jo2,"If they start selling the whole thing will crash, for them too. Unless they want to kill BTC they won't sell just yet. I believe the whole buying spree will eventually get us to less volatile market as the market cap will grow so large it will be difficult to even make a dent in price. Imagine if they really want to start using BTC to send trillions a day. How much one BTC would need to cost to achieve this. Currently if you want to send few billions you need a lot of BTC. Selling those billions causes big price fluctuation. Once one bitcoin is worth few millions it will be difficult to crash it, that's what any investor or any person using BTC to send money would want. The higher the price of BTC the more costly is to kill it, possible but very costly",t3_m4rl4q,2021-03-14 20:37:33,2021-03-14
