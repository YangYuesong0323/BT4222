No, you need to withdraw your coins to a wallet that gives you full control over your private keys. Gemini is not a wallet (and neither is Binance or any other exchange), it's an exchange (a place to buy/sell bitcoin, **not** a place to store bitcoin).  

You should store your coins in a proper wallet (open source, non-custodial, peer reviewed). But before that you need to understand how to backup and store it properly.

That's not true. It also has highest security, strongest assurances in regards to its scarcity (its scarcity is much tougher to change than coins that nobody uses), network effects, already built infrastructure. Sure, many of those things result from being the first, but they add up overtime into an unbreakable moat of security.

With this, it has been able to evolve in the most fair way possible. Other coins are typically anti-consensus; someone comes up with an idea and instead of trying to run it through the consensus mechanism, they fork Bitcoin or create a new coin.

There are also other coins that are effectively experiments where they change the underlying technology to achieve something that can do what they perceive as Bitcoin's core function, but better. They can be used as proof of concepts to help drive conversations that will eventually help to create a Bitcoin Improvement.

You could put consensus on a scale and treat it like a property of metals \[ie. conductivity of electricity\]. Right now, Bitcoin has the best consensus mechanism, and we can measure that consensus indirectly by looking at its hash rate. The higher that rate, the higher the adoption of Bitcoin meaning the more people consent to the state of bitcoin and trust its consensus mechanism.

Other coins lose that measure with proof of stake, but that leaves us with something that we don't yet know how to measure from a consensus point of view. Without a measure, it will never be a property you can list about said coin.",t3_lkbfs6,2021-02-15 22:48:05,2021-02-15

Instead of consuming garbage you don't need with money you don't have, save that money, save your energy and live sustainable minimalistic lifestyle. 

Anyone who says that bitcoin is bad for the environment is misinformed, bitcoin economic policy incentivizes saving rather than spending. 

The printing of money out of thin air is the main reason behind global pollution. You can't print bitcoin, you must exchange actual work, actual energy to produce bitcoin. 

The printing of money is a scam and a climate disaster. It encourages spending because the money loses value over time, it encourages instant gratification over long term planning, it encourages planned obsolescence over suitability.

a-I was okay taking risk/treating it as a lotto ticket/okay with losing 50%

b-I had at least $200k of other investments

Bitcoin is still highly volatile. I'm in it (I hope) for the long haul, but the idea that something can double quickly comes with huge risk. The alt coins-as we saw tonight-can literally lose 1/4 of their value instantly.

Eth I believe will run hotter than bitcoin for a multitude of reasons. However, once you get out of btc and eth, it's a completely different world. 

I'm not a chart master, but a lot of people have charts showing bitcoin compared to other cryptos and btc dominates them over the long term.

It will be shown by 2022, even if bitcoin hits $150-$250k, the majority of alt coins will go to zero.   


A huge part is demand-alt coins need constant retail demand to keep going.

Bitcoin loves retail demand, but the current stage of btc demand is coming from institutions.",t3_lk82mh,2021-02-15 15:49:35,2021-02-15

609,gniiyjb,t1_gniic08,"Most institutional adoption involves bitcoin, and bitcoin has historically persevered the most on a long term basis. Meanwhile alts come and go, and fail often. There are tens of thousands of alts and the top alts have come in and out of favor. Before eth it used to be litecoin. Now litecoin has barely recovered half of its ATH. If you bought litecoin in 2017, youd still be down. Alts also go down pretty hard, as much as 98% during the bear markets. Almost all the alts are in this massive long term downtrend on the alt vs btc chart. So I dont see any alts as a long term investment like bitcoin, although some may make good short term trades if you can time the market. If you have information on a specific altcoin and think its about to explode, then you could always take a side position on that coin. I do this sometimes, but i size these positions much smaller than my bitcoin position.",t3_lk82mh,2021-02-15 15:39:22,2021-02-15

When (and save for some black-swan event, it is *when*) Bitcoin hits £1,000,000, that £600 is £10,000.

£1,000,000 is not even close to the potential ceiling if you're talking a decade+.

A rule I use is to sell 10-20% when there is something other than bitcoin or fiat that I can get with that amount that will be truly life improving.

1576,gnj3y0w,t1_gnj3dym,I don't blame anyone for buying bitcoin but it shows two things. The stimulus money in a large portion was a waste of gov spending once again.  The government is about to piss a larger portion of cash away to those of us that will once again buy BTC with the next stimulus. Side note. Buying bitcoin still results in cash going to someone's hands even if it's the electric company via miners.

Ha, long story but even with the 2017 ATHs I couldn't be bothered to load up my old wallet (all my coins were stored in wallet.dat for those that remember the Bitcoin Core client backup feature) because I was so sure I had sold all my bitcoins and deleted the rest of the wallets. The only way I knew to access this was to re-load back into Bitcoin Core which needed to re-download the entire blockchain. I'm running it on an Azure server now as my home internet simply isn't that fast to load the entire blockchain (would take years). In all likelihood this 0.04 bitcoin was probably some residual for me to pay transaction fees back then and worth like 40 cents or something.

I saw a great thing on twitter regarding investments-instead of buy low and sell high, buy high and sell higher. We are conditioned as humans to brag how we made such a deal of buying low/selling high. Perhaps that is true gambling-a gambler is not in it for the gains, in it to patch our insecurities and brag how we made 10x 5x etc. The reality is that no one really cares how much we made on an investment. They care if we can help them make $.

The governor of California has accordingly made it illegal to pose for photos without masks based on this concrete scientific data that is irrefutable except by science deniers (and Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and other members of Big Brother will all delete/ban anybody who disagrees with this newly decided scientific fact - nay, scientific LAW! - since that would be spreading misinformation). As a side note, knowingly spreading HIV has been decriminalized in California.

Update: Dr. Fauci has now come out stating that you should wear between 3-5 masks in photos just to be extra cautious...and if you are involved in a Tinder hookup to be sure to wear your 3-5 masks and use a safe doggy position, not a risky missionary position where you are facing each other.",t3_lk1uxy,2021-02-15 15:21:08,2021-02-15
