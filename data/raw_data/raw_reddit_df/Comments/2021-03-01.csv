What I find more interesting is that we could essentially, technically, drop gold as a reserve of value tomorrow. Say nations/states decide it's worthless in their vaults, they flood the market with it. Gold mining stops immediately, because the price does not cover the operations anymore. There's largely enough gold at our disposal for any further industrial uses.

I think that something like what a lot of crypto traders do (whether they fashion themselves day traders or not, buying and selling numerous times a week/month and cross-crypto accumulation basically qualifies them as such) will always require ""more"" than what is needed to do the ol' wealth magnification.

More what?

Well timing markets is either impossible or incredibly difficult and error prone, depending on who you ask.  So that's a requirement of more knowledge, whose existence may not even be certain.

Also more emotional stability is needed.  This may be a consequence of the diversification that essentially comes with leveraging assets in one domain to attain assets in another through borrowing against them.  Buying 10 shitcoins isn't diversification in crypto when they tend to correlate with BTC any time it pumps or dumps.
