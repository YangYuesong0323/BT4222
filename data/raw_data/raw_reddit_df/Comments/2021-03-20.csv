There are more than 1 million miners  

There are less than 50000 nodes  

Therefore, very few (maybe zero) miners run nodes, and even if Job Negotiation is eventually implemented, all million-plus miners will continue to opt for their pools to build their blocks. This is mining centralization by inertia",t3_m16uon,2021-03-20 03:03:51,2021-03-20

39,griguj0,t1_gqcx8cb,"> isn‚Äôt any sort of hard fork

Right. It could be a return to the days when all miners ran nodes. If that actually happens, the pool's role becomes administrative - collect statistics from miners, receive reward coin, distribute reward to miners in proportion to their contribution  

While the pools choose which transactions to include in their miners' blocks, the small concentration of pools is a centralization risk for Bitcoin mining. This risk is amplified by the fact that multiple pools are controlled by single corporations",t3_m16uon,2021-03-20 03:11:44,2021-03-20

On the one hand, the rapid price boost made mining profitable for current generation devices (29 Joule per Terahash) with 12 cent electricity when the price passed USD18k. Make money mining from home!  

On the other hand, world trading bottlenecks have strangled chip supplies, so there are no mining devices available for delivery  

On the third hand, the current profitability boom will be soaked up by new miners as soon as new devices become available for delivery, boosting the difficulty, sending the break-even cost back down to 4 cent electricity  

On the 4th hand, the price might fall before your new devices are delivered",t3_m16uon,2021-03-20 03:37:00,2021-03-20

86,griimru,t1_gqi1zoa,"A quick comment  

The discussion of ""risk"" and ""loss"" is about the payments lost if the miner's hashing is delayed by waiting for the block to be ready. Developers in the pools have put a lot of coding hours into those  ""second next block"" optimizations, and that coding work has never been considered for backporting into Core. It would surprise me if the code was open anyway - maybe the Slush version is  

Food for thought: the Antminer S19 hash rate exhausts the nonce 25000 times per second, so the miner has to modify extra-nonce and recalculate the affected parts of the Merkle tree in 40 microseconds to avoid losing hashing time",t3_m16uon,2021-03-20 03:25:34,2021-03-20
87,griluj1,t1_griimru,"Yeah the ASIC speeds are insane these days. 

In the end, the same code needs to exist, it seems it comes down to (1) delaying it by pushing it on to political-risk slow-moving core to do it ""right"" or (2) implementing it somehow beyond core so that miners and pools can opt in (many options: core patch, core fork, core shim daemon, standalone daemon, etc).

Bitcoin also has a really low usage in terms of transactions compared to fiat, even though BTC has a $1 trillion market cap it only sees about 0.6% the transactions that GBP has. Seemingly proving that Bitcoin hasn't achieved a goal of being used for transactions, yet, and it'll likely rely on a solution like LN to actually gain any traction for transactions.

A life full of regret where they blame everyone around them for their own shortcomings. A life full of settling and stress.‚Å£
‚Å£
It's because of FEAR. They are scared.  Scared of #failure or scared of success.  Scared of what others may think of them & the truth is their fears prevent them from putting in the work today in order to have the lifestyle they dream about tomorrow.‚Å£
‚Å£
You want to know the fastest way to overcome fear & make your vision a reality?  Breakthrough the crust of mediocrity & become great.‚Å£
‚Å£
Do these 3 things:‚Å£
‚Å£
1) GET REAL WITH YOURSELF. You are who you are. Your current situation is your current situation. And the truth is life isn't fair & no one is going to give you shit. But no matter what resources or support you have today, that doesn't define who you can become tomorrow! Your mindset is your greatest advantage. Tell yourself you are a victim & you will easily find someone to blame for your own shortcomings. Tell yourself you are a #champion & that you and only you are responsible for your situation, & you will wake up one day sitting at the top of the mountain.‚Å£
‚Å£
2) BREAK THE RULES.  Society tries to put us in a box in order to control the masses. These ""rules"" put us at an unfair advantage and constrains our creativity. Douglas McAuthor once said ""you are remembered for the rules you break"" & that statement is spot on if your goal is to become great. Become comfortable breaking the rules (while staying legal). Push boundaries and ignore peoples opinions. Trust me, they will come around once they see you becoming #successful.‚Å£
‚Å£
3) BECOME AN IMPLEMENTOR. Stop talking about your plans. Stop hesitating & procrastinating & waiting for everything to become perfect. Doers win. Doers sacrifice free time with friends. Work through lunches.  Sacrifice sleep & partying on weekends. They are more focused on implementing their plan than wasting time watching tv. Fire, Ready, Aim & do whatever it takes, that's the Doers mantra.‚Å£
‚Å£
You have greatness inside you, now it's time to unlock it & make your vision a reality.‚Å£

And make no mistake, bitcoin will disrupt all 3, likely rendering them useless, just like the internet has disrupted many markets eating incumbent businesses. They are trying to adapt but will be squeezed out as the bitcoin network eclipses their main value propositions. Think how long distance calls over POTS lines were effectively eliminated by Voice over IP.

2343,grkkojf,t1_grju0qr,"You only pay ""again"" on the net gain between when you received payment, and when you spent/exchanged those funds for goods/services/dollars/etc.    
    
For example: Say it's Friday, and the exchange rate is 1btc = $60K. You get paid 0.005btc (which is worth $300 at the time), and the gov immediately taxes you 25% (0.000125btc, or $75) leaving you with 0.00375btc, or $225.     
     
By Sunday, bitcoin's price is $66K - a 10% increase - which means that your 0.00375btc is now worth $247.50. You go to the store Sunday afternoon and use all of that bitcoin to stock up on groceries for the week (let's just assume this grocery store accepts bitcoin directly, although their merchandise is still priced in USD).     
     
Now, the Tax Man doesn't think about your economic activity in terms of bitcoin; he thinks only in US dollars. All he cares about is that you were paid $225.00 (worth of bitcoin) on Friday that you later exchanged for $247.50 worth of goods on Sunday, which means the increased value of your bitcoin ""capital"" left you with a net ""gain"" (i.e.- ""profit"") of $22.50. If the capital gains tax rate is 40%, then the Tax Mam will insist that you owe him an additional $9.00 in capital gains tax come April 15th.    
     
As you can see, the $225 you received on Friday - after income taxes were automatically deducted from your wages - is never taxed again. It's only the difference in price between receiving and spending that is taxed.",t3_m8i5a7,2021-03-20 16:02:42,2021-03-20

Your math is flawed, by the way.  Bitcoin at the end of 2018 was lower than pretty much any time during 2019 (or since then).  

If you had cooked a little more at home and bought less expensive food, instead putting $10/week into bitcoin, you would have spent about $1,800 since January 1, 2018, and your bitcoin would be worth about $14,000 today.

Now I see what you mean. You misunderstood what I said. I wasn't clear enough, so let me elaborate on what I mean.

Note that I said *salary*. When I say ""streaming"" salary, this is not a more granular version of getting by the hour for each hour of work. I literally mean salary, except instead of getting paid every two weeks, for example, it's pro-rated to every minute. I.e. salary is getting streaming every minute, all 24 hours of the day, 7 days a week, each week of the whole year, regardless if whether one is on vacation that week or not. This is just like getting a regular salary, just more granular (i.e. take agreed annual salary X, and divide it into ~526k minute payments, instead of 26 biweekly payments).

One benefit of this, is if streaming period can get standardized (e.g. one minute), then income streams and expense streams can be made easily comparable. Example: my income stream from my job is 25 cents/min after taxes; mortgage is 2.7 cents/min; student loan payment is 2.1 cents/min; car loan payment is 1.6 cents/min; auto insurance 0.27 cents/min; etc. Notice how this is easier to compare than my biweekly income payments vs monthly (steady) mortgage payments vs monthly student loan psyments (where amount is slightly variable each month because there is a different number of interest accruing days) vs quarterly auto insurance payment vs bi-annual property tax payment vs annual Autodesk software license payment, etc.",t3_m8i5a7,2021-03-20 11:54:23,2021-03-20

The hardest part of progress is formulating the problems and questions correctly. In these kinds of orgs that usually comes from the top down, and all development flows from that. Getting that right actually requires the rare judgment and unique ways of thinking. The ground level stuff is fungible, at some point it mostly devolves to code/physics/math/engineering monkey work.

> He is by far the single smartest person that I have ever worked with ... period. I can't estimate his IQ but he is very very intelligent. And not the typical egg head kind of smart. He has a real applied mind. He literally sucks the knowledge and experience out of people that he is around. He borrowed all of my college texts on rocket propulsion when we first started working together in 2001. We also hired as many of my colleagues in the rocket and spacecraft business that were willing to consult with him.

...

> Unlike Paypal, with SpaceX Musk had to actually pick things up. Initially, he relied on textbooks to form the bulk of his rocket knowledge.

...

> But as SpaceX hired one brilliant person after another, Musk realized that he could tap into their stores of knowledge.

...

> One SpaceX engineer, Kevin Brogan, stated ‚ÄúI thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff. Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he would learn 90% of what you know.‚Äù

> Likewise, the ""CTO"" in his official SpaceX title is descriptive, not ceremonial: Elon Musk taught himself how to design and build rockets.

> ""I'd never seen anything like it,"" says Chris Thompson, explaining what persuaded him to leave a senior position at Boeing to oversee ""structures"" at SpaceX. ""He was the quickest learner I've ever come across. You had this guy who knew everything from a business point of view, but who was also clearly capable of knowing everything from a technical point of view‚Äîand the place he was creating was a blank sheet of paper.""

Elon wants a more persistent and expansive human race. Mars is the crown jewel of many projects he has pursued to that extent.

Elon has worked on emergent finance and has expressed his recognition that progress will require a more innovative economic framework, including but not limited to that of global finance. 

The capacity for Bitcoin to adequately serve as a base layer for an *inter*national(planetary) monetary system, whether in your eyes, Elon‚Äôs, or mine, is directly relative to the immediate viability of the system and it‚Äôs related versatility. Elon has acknowledged the immediate viability in many ways, including $TSLA‚Äôs ballooning stake and the tweet you mentioned about Bitcoin being *better* than fiat.

2976,grkx6pi,t1_grktxsc,"Atm it's like any investment, I'm mainly looking to capital growth. I also believe somewhat in the philosophy behind it.

There are current options to borrow against it, which makes sense if you think the price will keep increasing. Borrow and buy more bitcoin, or other crypto you can stake for further income. You can also loan your Bitcoin. The income from the Bitcoin you loaned pays the interest on the cash equivalent you borrowed. Something like that :)

I don't do either of these currently, but in future, who knows? As the market matures, hopefully security will, and more options will be available too.

Sell your bitcoin and it's potentially a taxation triggering event, depending where you live. Borrow against it, and it can become a tax deduction depending how you structure the loan.

If bitcoin does what a lot of us believe it will, a few Bitcoin could become generational wealth. Heck, it nearly is now. Maybe it doesn't help me personally if I don't sell, but like I said, I have a grandson now as well as a daughter to try look out for. Maybe they will benefit if I don't.
