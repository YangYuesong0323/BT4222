Because it lacks transparency its also one of its main pros and cons at teh same time.  if u can go into some official bitcoin place and get an account then you lose all power. In fact people who hold crypto at exchanges and not personal offline wallets already have lost ownership of it. Secondly the way crypto prices work is very simple. Lets say you buy in 100k worth of btc. Then someone mines some or acquires it anyway anyhow and cashes it out. Your 100k worth of crypto just lost value. Once your 100k deposit and for that matter everyone elses cash runs out crypto starts tanking. Crypto would work if no one cashed it out for fiat but that simply wont ever happen i dont think.

This is a fallacy. When someone exchanges bitcoin for fiat, the bitcoin changes hands; it does not disappear.  One thing that will affect the value of one person's bitcoin is another bitcoin owner losing their keys.  Lost bitcoin creates scarcity, and the more scarce Bitcoin becomes, the greater its value will be.   Utility is what defines Bitcoin's value.  If enough people stopped acquiring Bitcoin, this negative consensus would damage Bitcoin's perceived worth.",t3_mcgdh2,2021-03-25 21:57:26,2021-03-25

From my testing, I can tell that it detects some words and then decides if the whole context is positive, negative or neutral.

For example negations would be scored as negative (no, never etc..) and so would swear words. 
Positive words such as happy, thrilled, excited, yes etc... would score a positive sentiment.

I used to think I was pretty good at chess. I had never studied formally, but I was smart. No one I had met could ever compete with me. I always had a big advantage. 

But then, one day, I had the opportunity to play against a state champion. The difference was striking. He could glance at the board and know in a second what would take me minutes to reason out. He was truly on another level. I was shocked at the magnitude of the difference. 

Trump is like this. It is frustrating that all I can do is call him a corrupt liar. But all politicians are corrupt liars, so no one understands. I lack the words to properly communicate the issue. 

Trump isn't just a liar the same way other politicians are liars. He's a CHAMPION of lies. 

He doesn't simply tell untruths, he launches an unrelenting assault against reality. He retaliates against anyone that contradicts him, and rewards those who parrot what he wants to hear. He relies on repetition and the size of his audience to push through any viewpoint he wishes, and he moves on so fast that people have to scramble to correct the misinformation of yesterday while he's already laying new tracks.

Anyone who does even a modicum of fact-checking knows he's a compulsive liar, but he appeals to emotion over fact. When people are emotional, they don't even want to hear the truth.

‚ÄúBad news, detective. We got a situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWorse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars‚Äô worth of bitcoins.‚Äù

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. ‚ÄúWhat kind of monster  would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency:  virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not  subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any  leads?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet. But mark my  words: we‚Äôre going to figure out who did this and we‚Äôre going to take  them down ‚Ä¶ provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.‚Äù

‚ÄúEasy, chief,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAny rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on it.‚Äù

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It  was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public  sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

‚ÄúHome Depot‚Ñ¢ Presents the Police!¬Æ‚Äù I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a  small picture of Ron Paul. ‚ÄúNobody move unless you want to!‚Äù They  didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúNow, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?‚Äù No one spoke up.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt seem like they did.

‚ÄúSeriously,  guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I‚Äôm just going to stand here  and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold  bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.‚Äù

Nothing.  These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn‚Äôt  care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I  figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A  pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth.  Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

‚ÄúSubway‚Ñ¢ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!¬Æ‚Äù I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

‚ÄúStop  right there!‚Äù I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always  try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a  private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay  between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby,  it will never happen.

I was losing  him. ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôll pay you to stop!‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúWhat would you consider  an appropriate price point for stopping? I‚Äôll offer you a thirteenth of  an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‚ÄòBob Barr ‚Äò08‚Äô extra-large  long-sleeved men‚Äôs T-shirt!‚Äù

He  turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had  every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a  quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox  less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

‚ÄúAll right, all right!‚Äù the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. ‚ÄúI give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you do it?‚Äù I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos‚Ñ¢ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs¬Æ on the guy.

‚ÄúBecause I was afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfraid?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a central banker.‚Äù

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

‚ÄúLet  this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the  street,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNo matter how many bitcoins you steal, you‚Äôll never  take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of  personal and economic freedom.‚Äù

2. March is considered as a red month and people do sell on march for tax purposes and buy back after 30 days

3422,gs5x34z,t1_gs51qo4,">Mega dip

To preface, I'm trying to help, not insult or gatekeep.

I think you should do some more research before either investing anymore or starting out. This really isn't a mega dip or even a big dip. Anyone who has been involved in bitcoin for longer than a couple of years has seen mega dips where the price has dropped by 80% in just a couple of days.

Investing in general isn't for the light of heart, and I would say cryptocurrency is even more volatile. Losing 5% is nothing compared to the loses seen before. 

Do not invest more than you're willing to lose, **ever**.

If I had invested more in bitcoin back in 2012 when I started out I'd be rich. But I would've also been way too heavily invested for my income at the time and would've shat my pants when the true dip occured. 

You may feel like you miss out by not putting much money in, and you do, but you also prevent bankruptcy in case something bad happens.",t3_mcqelh,2021-03-25 20:45:20,2021-03-25

Bitcoin is volatile, that's okay and it's expected. Volatility is what happens during price discovery and bitcoin is a new asset like nothing that has never existed before. Over 99.9999% of people don't understand bitcoin yet and it's going through price discovery. Most people don't even really understand money. All of the day traders playing with leveraged futures and options increase the volatility. Bitcoin will remain volatile until it finds it's true value, which I expect is somewhere at 7 digits of US dollars. I'm not expecting this to happen soon but I do expect it to happen before 2033, considering over 99% of bitcoin will be mined before summer 2032. Bitcoin's price is volatile, that's okay and it's expected.

This is all from the ""what is moeny"" section of **ECON102: Principles of Macroeconomics**

Money, ultimately, is defined by people and what they do. When people use something as a medium of exchange, it becomes money. If people were to begin accepting basketballs as payment for most goods and services, basketballs would be money. We will learn in this chapter that changes in the way people use money have created new types of money and changed the way money is measured in recent decades.

The Functions of Money
Money serves three basic functions. By definition, it is a medium of exchange. It also serves as a unit of account and as a store of value‚Äîas the ‚Äúmack‚Äù did in Lompoc.

A Medium of Exchange
The exchange of goods and services in markets is among the most universal activities of human life. To facilitate these exchanges, people settle on something that will serve as a medium of exchange‚Äîthey select something to be money.

We can understand the significance of a medium of exchange by considering its absence. Barter occurs when goods are exchanged directly for other goods. Because no one item serves as a medium of exchange in a barter economy, potential buyers must find things that individual sellers will accept. A buyer might find a seller who will trade a pair of shoes for two chickens. Another seller might be willing to provide a haircut in exchange for a garden hose. Suppose you were visiting a grocery store in a barter economy. You would need to load up a truckful of items the grocer might accept in exchange for groceries. That would be an uncertain affair; you could not know when you headed for the store which items the grocer might agree to trade. Indeed, the complexity‚Äîand cost‚Äîof a visit to a grocery store in a barter economy would be so great that there probably would not be any grocery stores! A moment‚Äôs contemplation of the difficulty of life in a barter economy will demonstrate why human societies invariably select something‚Äîsometimes more than one thing‚Äîto serve as a medium of exchange, just as prisoners in federal penitentiaries accepted mackerel.

A Unit of Account
Ask someone in the United States what he or she paid for something, and that person will respond by quoting a price stated in dollars: ‚ÄúI paid $75 for this radio,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI paid $15 for this pizza.‚Äù People do not say, ‚ÄúI paid five pizzas for this radio.‚Äù That statement might, of course, be literally true in the sense of the opportunity cost of the transaction, but we do not report prices that way for two reasons. One is that people do not arrive at places like Radio Shack with five pizzas and expect to purchase a radio. The other is that the information would not be very useful. Other people may not think of values in pizza terms, so they might not know what we meant. Instead, we report the value of things in terms of money.

Money serves as a unit of account, which is a consistent means of measuring the value of things. We use money in this fashion because it is also a medium of exchange. When we report the value of a good or service in units of money, we are reporting what another person is likely to have to pay to obtain that good or service.

A Store of Value
The third function of money is to serve as a store of value, that is, an item that holds value over time. Consider a $20 bill that you accidentally left in a coat pocket a year ago. When you find it, you will be pleased. That is because you know the bill still has value. Value has, in effect, been ‚Äústored‚Äù in that little piece of paper.

Money, of course, is not the only thing that stores value. Houses, office buildings, land, works of art, and many other commodities serve as a means of storing wealth and value. Money differs from these other stores of value by being readily exchangeable for other commodities. Its role as a medium of exchange makes it a convenient store of value.

Because money acts as a store of value, it can be used as a standard for future payments. When you borrow money, for example, you typically sign a contract pledging to make a series of future payments to settle the debt. These payments will be made using money, because money acts as a store of value.

Money is not a risk-free store of value, however. We saw in the chapter that introduced the concept of inflation that inflation reduces the value of money. In periods of rapid inflation, people may not want to rely on money as a store of value, and they may turn to commodities such as land or gold instead.

Types of Money
Although money can take an extraordinary variety of forms, there are really only two types of money: money that has intrinsic value and money that does not have intrinsic value.

Commodity money is money that has value apart from its use as money. Mackerel in federal prisons is an example of commodity money. Mackerel could be used to buy services from other prisoners; they could also be eaten.

Gold and silver are the most widely used forms of commodity money. Gold and silver can be used as jewelry and for some industrial and medicinal purposes, so they have value apart from their use as money. The first known use of gold and silver coins was in the Greek city-state of Lydia in the beginning of the seventh century B.C. The coins were fashioned from electrum, a natural mixture of gold and silver.

One disadvantage of commodity money is that its quantity can fluctuate erratically. Gold, for example, was one form of money in the United States in the 19th century. Gold discoveries in California and later in Alaska sent the quantity of money soaring. Some of this nation‚Äôs worst bouts of inflation were set off by increases in the quantity of gold in circulation during the 19th century. A much greater problem exists with commodity money that can be produced. In the southern part of colonial America, for example, tobacco served as money. There was a continuing problem of farmers increasing the quantity of money by growing more tobacco. The problem was sufficiently serious that vigilante squads were organized. They roamed the countryside burning tobacco fields in an effort to keep the quantity of tobacco, hence money, under control. (Remarkably, these squads sought to control the money supply by burning tobacco grown by other farmers.)

Another problem is that commodity money may vary in quality. Given that variability, there is a tendency for lower-quality commodities to drive higher-quality commodities out of circulation. Horses, for example, served as money in colonial New England. It was common for loan obligations to be stated in terms of a quantity of horses to be paid back. Given such obligations, there was a tendency to use lower-quality horses to pay back debts; higher-quality horses were kept out of circulation for other uses. Laws were passed forbidding the use of lame horses in the payment of debts. This is an example of Gresham‚Äôs law: the tendency for a lower-quality commodity (bad money) to drive a higher-quality commodity (good money) out of circulation. Unless a means can be found to control the quality of commodity money, the tendency for that quality to decline can threaten its acceptability as a medium of exchange.

But something need not have intrinsic value to serve as money. Fiat money is money that some authority, generally a government, has ordered to be accepted as a medium of exchange. The currency‚Äîpaper money and coins‚Äîused in the United States today is fiat money; it has no value other than its use as money. You will notice that statement printed on each bill: ‚ÄúThis note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.‚Äù

Later he came Tesla which was a started by two men \[5\]. Elon Musk didn't feel like he got enough attention so after a series of court battles, he managed to kick the original founders out. They settled out of court and Elon was allowed to call himself ""co-founder"" of Tesla \[6\]. Once he became leader, he fired a quarter of the company and basically made a bunch of promises to gov'ts to get subsidies. Like he promised CA they'd make battery packs that could be swapped out with machines. CA gave them tons of subsidies and they never produced anything \[7\]. Tesla's entire existence is basically dependent on subsidies \[8\] (they are currently being sued by Germany and Canada for subsidy fraud). Tesla also faced a lawsuit because their factories have abnormally high injury rates and are not built to proper safety standards. One worker said they don‚Äôt have yellow safety lines because Musk doesn‚Äôt like the color yellow \[9\] and has fired safety officials for reporting unsafe conditions \[10\].

SpaceX is basically reusing 70s technology developed by Lockheed for automated self-landing. Neither Tesla nor SpaceX has ever actually made profits. Additionally, Tesla cars actually produce more CO2 in their lifetimes than a diesal car \[11\].

He defrauded Tesla investors billions of dollars to bail out his cousin‚Äôs company SolarCity \[12\] (investors are also currently suing him for this). His Boring Company is inexplicably still getting funded by Silicon Valley investors despite using unsafe tunneling methods \[13\]. He is continuing to make absurd claims about his company to get more subsidies from gov‚Äôts, basically repeating the cycle he did with Tesla.

Tell me if this sounds like someone else you know of. Elon musk is a person born rich who tries to downplay his parent‚Äôs ties to his success. He‚Äôs never run a profitable company and relies heavily on media attention to continue to be able to scam people and governments and keep his companies afloat. He is self-obsessed and lacks self-awareness.

Like If you agree today that you're paying 1BTC for the new car, but spreading the payments evenly out over e.g. 5 years, you'd quickly end up wildly overpaying for the loan if past rises are anything to go by (It was like $350 5 years ago lol)  


If you peg it to the dollar value of the car, then you're not really ""paying in btc"": rather you're giving tesla btc, they're converting it to dollars, then wiping that value off the loan.  


Does this mean you make a single btc payment into the loan account and evade collections until the value of the btc rises enough to pay off the dollar car loan?  


Alternatively, is this a clever way of applying potentially insane interest rates to financing? E.g. You agree to pay 1BTC over 5 years and if you don't come up with your own satoshis, you have to buy them off the Tesla exchange each payment date for the going exchange rate that day.",t3_mbznz6,2021-03-25 03:21:54,2021-03-25

I just think it's more of a smart marketing move on tesla's part where it solidifies there brand as being ""the future"". It's not really a profound revelation that you can now buy a tesla with bitcoin. 

This would be like if walmart came out and said they are now accepting gold to buy products.

Elon Musk comes from money. His family owns an emerald mine Zambia that allowed him to grow up living a lavish lifestyle \[1\]. Some of his family's fortune actually comes from some pretty shady businesses. Despite this, he tried to claim his father is broke \[2\] and has tried to paint himself as coming to America with nothing. Elon's big break was Zip2 which him and his brother funded using his father's money \[3\]. He made $22 million when Zip2 got bought out.

He's not actually a cofounder of PayPal. What happened is he started a company called X.com with the money he made from Zip2. Musk basically grew his x.com's userbase by giving money away for referrals. His business was bought by x.com's competitor Cofinity primarily because x.com had some important paperwork for financial regulation that was pushed through earlier. He was a crappy manager and X.com was losing a lot of money and important talent was leaving. His employees eventually got fed up and enacted a coup to get rid of him \[4\] (this was the second time he got kicked out as CEO). Either way he $165 million when PayPal got bought out because he owned a bunch of shares.

Later he came Tesla which was a started by two men \[5\]. Elon Musk didn't feel like he got enough attention so after a series of court battles, he managed to kick the original founders out. They settled out of court and Elon was allowed to call himself ""co-founder"" of Tesla \[6\]. Once he became leader, he fired a quarter of the company and basically made a bunch of promises to gov'ts to get subsidies. Like he promised CA they'd make battery packs that could be swapped out with machines. CA gave them tons of subsidies and they never produced anything \[7\]. Tesla's entire existence is basically dependent on subsidies \[8\] (they are currently being sued by Germany and Canada for subsidy fraud). Tesla also faced a lawsuit because their factories have abnormally high injury rates and are not built to proper safety standards. One worker said they don‚Äôt have yellow safety lines because Musk doesn‚Äôt like the color yellow \[9\] and has fired safety officials for reporting unsafe conditions \[10\].

SpaceX is basically reusing 70s technology developed by Lockheed for automated self-landing. Neither Tesla nor SpaceX has ever actually made profits. Additionally, Tesla cars actually produce more CO2 in their lifetimes than a diesal car \[11\].

He defrauded Tesla investors billions of dollars to bail out his cousin‚Äôs company SolarCity \[12\] (investors are also currently suing him for this). His Boring Company is inexplicably still getting funded by Silicon Valley investors despite using unsafe tunneling methods \[13\]. He is continuing to make absurd claims about his company to get more subsidies from gov‚Äôts, basically repeating the cycle he did with Tesla.

Tell me if this sounds like someone else you know of. Elon musk is a person born rich who tries to downplay his parent‚Äôs ties to his success. He‚Äôs never run a profitable company and relies heavily on media attention to continue to be able to scam people and governments and keep his companies afloat. He is self-obsessed and lacks self-awareness.

Wtf does this have to do with them as a car company? If you've ever spent any significant amount of time in a Tesla, you'd know how many quality control issues they have. Simple things like panels being horribly misaligned to serious safety issues like rear seat belts not being properly attached. Stuff that the vast majority of car companies nailed down eons ago. My partner has a Model 3 and I was shocked at how uncomfortable the seats were for a nearly $60K car. They've had to take the car to a dealership several times for weird noises it makes while driving, among other issues.
