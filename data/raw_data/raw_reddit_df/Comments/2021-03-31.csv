* M1 is a narrow measure of the money supply that includes physical  currency, demand deposits, traveler‚Äôs checks, and other checkable  deposits.
* M1 does not include financial assets, such as savings accounts and bonds.
* The M1 is no longer used as a guide for monetary policy in the  United States due to the lack of correlation between it and other  economic variables.1

According to the Bank of Canada, the M1 supply increased from 1.39 to 1.41 trillion dollars between December to Jan. [https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/money-supply-m1](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/money-supply-m1)

Namely, the biggest definining characteristic!! **Who receives commission fees and who sees direct profits  from the people they personally sign up?** 
  
-Are you stating the bitcoin owners only make money if they *personally* sign up more people? (pyramid schemes set up profit based off rewarding individials for directly setting up people UNDER them). 

Secondly, **where does bitcoin or people involved in its infrastructure promise  ever increasing gains with 0 risk and a quick profit?**  

- Sure there are shills, but they exist in every arena. Someone cannot focus on the existence of bitcoin shills yet ignore examples all the gold, precious metal, oil, forex, or stock ones. **It is extremely evident based on multiple dips/crashes alongside  open discussed on volatile/risky bitcoin can be.** Also, the most common time frame when speaking of bitcoin is YEARS or decades. 

Thirdly, where is the hidden details of how it operates  and secrecy behind any of it? Secrecy is huge hallmark of pyramid/pozi schemes. 
  
- **Bitcoin is one of they most transparent systems in the world.** It is open information how they are created, how many are created down to 10 minute intervals, and the complete path every single bitcoin travels. It is all open, public information.

And i ve also heard from someone about silver and gold. Actually, most things i know, i ve heard from others. I was born, pretty ignorant about the world. How about you? :)   


> you get where I‚Äôm going hopefully 

No? Talking to someone about something is the oldest way to transmit info. I talked to a friend about that precious metal dealer online. He told that to another friend, that told that to someone else. At the end, we all went to buy there. Is the precious metal dealer a ponzi scheme?  


Also, when i talk to someone about bitcoin ... i don't make any money out of it. In a ponzi scheme, the more you ""convince"" ppl about the thing, the more you earn. The ONLY thing i ve earned from talking about BTC or gold dealer to friends, is the satisfaction they wont lose all their wealth with the hyperinflation lurking around. But i gain no financial benefit from it.  


> That‚Äôs where all new money in Bitcoin comes from. 

No, the money comes from investors. The more is invested in bitcoin, the more it goes up. Just like gold. If tomorrow, an additional 11 trillion is added to gold, it will double in price. If tomorrow 1 trillion is added to BTC, it will double in price. If tomorrow 15 billion is added to LTC, it will double.  


Basically, you re saying that the stock market is a ponzi scheme, because that's how the crypto market works.  
I ve seen an interesting [documentary](https://youtu.be/Dp3IOVw-vy4) about the history stock market. In the very beginning, some sold stocks for a thing that could transform a chicken into a cow ... in the crypto world, some things will be scam, just like in the stock market.

Judging future technology using a current understanding of science will always result in you believing said technology is impossible, because if it was possible under the current understanding we‚Äôd have built it already.

I have no doubt that mikhail is an accomplished physicist, but his life work has revolved around classical physics, while yes quantum physics is still physics, it‚Äôs like saying an aerospace engineer and an electrical engineer have the same knowledge base merely because they are both engineers.


Like even his understanding of quantum computing

‚ÄúA useful quantum computer needs to process a set of continuous parameters that is larger than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe‚Äù is just flat out wrong.

A continuous parameter is one that can be of any value at a given point in time.

That is not how a qubit is used.

Yes each qubit is a continuous parameter, but the way we compute state is we use matrix multiplication, with the arrangement of qubits being represented as a matrix, so we tensor the two ‚Äúcontinuous parameters‚Äù together to get a new continuous parameter that when collapsed will be the result of the previous twos tensor

A ponzi scheme involves giving your funds to a individual or entity, who promises to use those funds to make more money with your money. However, instead of ""use those funds to make more money with your money"", they instead do nothing to make more money with your money, and just give your money back to earlier investors (as well as keep a portion for themselves).

Which requires an ever growing amount of new investors to sustain itself. Eventually the flood of new investors dries up. And because this trusted person / entity was never actually making anything of profit with the funds of the investors, the scheme collapses on itself.

Honestly, no one, not one person, has ever adequatly been able to explain to me why Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. I've seen your response and others a million times. And it is not what a ponzi scheme is.",t3_mgf51d,2021-03-31 02:50:57,2021-03-31

Er... What do you think this is? Crypto is global, but many here are from countries like the U.S. and the UK. I'm no expert on the UK, but in the U.S. the People *are the government*. The U.S. isn't Hong Kong, or China, or North Korea. In any country there will be wealth and power. The whole point of the U.S. (American Revolution) was a new model, one where the wealth and power wasn't concentrated on the top, with a king/dictator. Instead, the government was to be small and restrained, and citizens would retain the wealth and power. Government was given the *tiniest* bit of power in the Constitution, to handle bare necessities (like war). It worked. The United States became the richest most powerful country, with largest middle class, the world has ever seen, almost immediately. People still literally die to get *in*.

It's true the U.S. government today has more power than its should (and was meant to have). Much of this is due to the ignorance of the population (on things like money, economics, and even the Constitution), and some is due to shadowy banking interests influencing things for their own ends. This being the case, though, the People still retain the majority of power; but just like a muscle, it's only strong when called on and used. The People *must* recognize the power they have and demand plus use it, as it's not going to be offered. Freedom is not free (ask Myanmar). People like [Jerry Brito and Coin Center](https://www.coincenter.org/bitcoin-taxation-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/) are exactly what we need, but he needs broad support and awareness of the aforementioned too.

Keep in mind that these are only the gains as well, you can withdraw the basis without taxes. So if you've doubled your money in BTC you can go and spend like $160K in BTC and only half of that would be the gains so you still pay 0%.

I agree! That's why the U.S. Constitution was set up the way it was. It said *nobody* should need to pay taxes. Not Direct taxes. This is what many who attempt to ""sock it to"" the rich don't understand. Who has better lawyers and influence over government, the common man or the rich? The answer is obvious. So what happens is people vote in favor of big government with big gov programs (welfare or Universal Basic Income, for example) then say okay government force the rich to pay! There are more common people (to elect politicians) so politicians say as you wish, and establish the bigger government programs. However, when it's time to pay the bill the rich end up escaping, due to better lawyers/influence, and the poorer people end up having made themselves even worse off by being stuck with the bill and higher taxes.

The founders of the U.S. had the right model from the beginning, understanding how to keep wealth more evenly distributed, which was not taxing anybody directly. Up until 1913 there was no income tax, for anybody. And, yes, there were still roads, and bridges, and a military etc.",t3_mgr4a1,2021-03-31 09:47:23,2021-03-31

Are you comparing apples to apples?  Let's assume so - in that case, my statement is still likely correct.  Her 2% of income is likely to be still a higher dollar amount than your 44%.

When you earn a salary, there are few deductions/credits available.  When you sell capital assets, you are taxed already at a lower rate, and you can write-off and carry forward losses.  

**THIS IS BY DESIGN**.  It is to encourage more people to be capital investors and grow the economy instead of sitting on a pile of cash.  The tax code encourages wealthy people to risk their assets to grow the economy and offers a reprieve for losses.  Basically, the system is meant to encourage people to not work day-to-day with salary and instead manage capital investments.

The actual problem is not the tax code, but mobility.  Someone who starts earning wages should be able to ""move up"".  That requires the ability to save and invest money earned.  If people can't save enough money, then the gap between rich and poor will get wider.  Today - it's not impossible to move up, but, the system isn't going to help you.  You must help yourself, and fail, and fail again, and maybe if you are skilled and lucky, you can make it higher.

However, briefly, I'll just say I agree with the position of former congressman and presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul, meaning, the 13th Amendment should just be repealed. Even as it stands the government operates under a position of ""voluntary compliance"" which is on the IRS's own literature. Of course, government enforces in a very aggressive and forceful manner which makes things seem less ""voluntary"" and more like no choice but what else would one expect.

>Also, your example says ‚Äúkeeping wealth more evenly distributed,‚Äù but includes the wealthy using their money to escape taxation. 

I'm not sure what point you're making here. Rich people work very hard to become rich (in many or most cases anyway); it only makes sense they'd continue working to *stay* rich. If they were freed from having to work on that, they'd have more time to actually help work on continuing to improve things (solving climate change etc). Self-made successes are generally some of the nicest most caring, generous people you'll find, because they understand all perspectives of life. Mark Cuban is an example. Bill Gates is an example. Such people don't need to be forced to be philanthropic, and shouldn't be on general principal. Find me such people in Communist environments. They don't exist.

Yes, and the quality of life of Americans has been steadily decreasing, with the middle class shrinking dramatically. Yet that shouldn't be the case, because capitalism naturally *raises* quality of life for everyone, even the poor. For example, even the poorest Americans typically have access to clean drinking water, and many have a phone/computer, something that would blow the mind of any Egyptian king, in their pocket.",t3_mgr4a1,2021-03-31 15:40:40,2021-03-31

2876,gsvvzdt,t1_gsvsp3r,"Taxes are necessary in a society where we want public ownership of things.  If we did not have taxes all roads, bridges, land, military, police, and etc would be privatized.

I am for more taxes, but I am also for smarter spending.  Taxes are usually one of the only ways to ensure people that make boatloads of money pay their proportional amount for the protection they receive do to our laws and global influence.  It comes down to math, lets take an example of roads and amazon.  Roads have a life based on factors such as weight and time (excluding weather).  So the more time a car drives on the road the more wear and tear that can occur on that road which is than magnified by the extent of the weight of the vehicle.   Amazon uses the roads more than a regular individual or even a small business, but even then, the proportional amount of taxes do not cover those expenses.  Now roads are a very basic example, and a simple infrastructure.  But this can be applied to anti hacking efforts of government agencies to protect companies, or USA waging war on behalf of USA corporations, or even Patent protection.

Now lets go into a simple example, Tom Brady had his superbowl Jersey stolen and the FBI spent time and resources to find this Jersey.  The NFL or Tom Brady did not have to pay for this directly (one could only argue Tom did through taxes since the NFL pays basically no taxes), but this goes to show us that people (while not everyone) in higher income brackets or people that attain more wealth have more tools at their disposal and should have to pay proportionally for those.

Now you statement that ""Taxes make everyone poorer.""  This is false, as often people in lower income brackets pay less into taxes that what they receive back (generally), of course this is also depending on geographical area.  If let say we had 0% taxes, wealth could easily snowball and create massive asset inflation that would disproportionately affect people in lower incomes, this is actually happening now due to the stimulus money that was given to business.  This money was often used for payroll (can include self in that) and then they get a tax deduction on top of that.  Research has been done to show a lot of this added money was then used to buy assets rather than just spending it.

Probably a longer answer than you thought I would ive, but hey maybe you will read it.
TL:DR rich pay disproportional taxes compared to the benefits they receive from public resources.

Now, going into how tax money is spend, that would be a huge issue on its own and will likely never get resolved unless we have 100% access to invoices for all expenses and its publicly available.",t3_mgr4a1,2021-03-31 13:28:57,2021-03-31

-Stay calm and let your investment ride (HODL). Learn how to control your emotion and become more aware of your own FOMO and FUD. Panic sell and buy at all time high is not a good strategy.

-Don‚Äôt check every two minutes the prices help.

-Look into staking.

-Don‚Äôt try to day trade, especially if you are a beginner (some publish research suggest the most profitable accounts are the ones of death people). Look into psychological biases of investing (confirmation, anchor price, loss/gain perception etc).

Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm your customer and want to buy one paper Bitcoin from you the bank. You agree to sell it to me for 58500 or whatever the price is. Now the price goes up to 62000 and I want to cash out, what are you the bank going to do? Just cough up 3500 of your own money to pay me out of the goodness of your own heart? That seems unlikely to me.

IMO no, they may be shady but they‚Äôre not stupid. They may not let a customer redeem coins to the chain but a pure paper coin is a huge risk for a company to take on because it‚Äôs effectively a short position on the asset in question. They‚Äôre very happy if it goes down but very unhappy if it goes up. So they do what any sensible bank does and instead of taking an outright position on an asset try to sell you shovels while remaining neutral on the asset. So they ‚Äúhedge‚Äù the paper Bitcoin they sell you by simply buying Bitcoin in the back-end. Why take on big directional risk on a crazy volatile asset when the big money is in fees and spread? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they do all sorts of weird stuff with swaps and CFDs and such in banks, but hedging risk ultimately will involve someone buying coin so the pressures on the market will be the same.

ATH is always in relation to currency pair. For Bitcoin it's almost always reported as BTCUSD pair. In this case, you referenced BTCEUR pair which previously was at 50.7k Euro (at the same time it was 62k USD). Today we reached 51k Euro (despite it being only 59.8k USD). This difference is caused  by $ increasing its value in relation to EUR in the last two weeks.
