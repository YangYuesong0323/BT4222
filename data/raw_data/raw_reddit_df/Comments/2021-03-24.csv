b) would expose all addresses you are interested in (that you lookup on the blockchain), essentially giving lots of private information to the entity that runs the node, like showing which addresses are yours, i.e. how much BTC you have, where else you transfer these BTC to, etc.

A business cannot just switch of its nodes, unless they shut down Bitcoin payments. 

You may switch it off, but if it's switched of for too long, it takes some time to catch up with the latest blocks. Thus you have an incentive to keep your node online ""long enough"".

Yes, it does run a full BTC node and Lightning Node simultaneously, and it's easy to enable other services like BTCpay (open source app for commercial transactions on the Lightning Network). I used a Pi4 with 8GB RAM, but that's overkill. It will work just fine with the 2GB or 4GB version.

All the parts cost me about $280 on Amazon. That includes: a 64GB SD card (also overkill, you probably only need a 16GB), Pi4 8GB, power supply, heat-sink case for the Pi, a 1TB SSD (the blockchain is only 350GB, so a 500GB SSD would work), an enclosure for the SSD, and a 3.5"" touchscreen.

The 1TB SSD and enclosure was a significant portion of the cost (\~$120).

The guide gives an Amazon parts list with specific hardware recommendations that they have tested and are known to work well. I think they also sell pre-assembled ones that are ready to go, if you're not so interested in setting it all up yourself.",t3_mc16l9,2021-03-24 21:57:14,2021-03-24

Sorry, *that* I can't help with. :D Good luck!

I recommend running a full node if you can, but it's also possible to run a lightweight node that does not contain the full blockchain:

The lightweight node wouldn't require the SSD and you might be able to run it on cheaper hardware. I haven't looked into it much myself.",t3_mc16l9,2021-03-24 22:20:27,2021-03-24

In 1910 JP Morgan, and senator Aldrich among a few others, met in secret on jekkyl Island,  and on the night of November 22nd 1910, they signed a decree to finance the central bank and henceforth they owned the central bank.  The Fed as you know it now, is just a regulatory board, but in truth they have no power, the money they print is paid back with interest to the 'Fed'.  
Simply Google search,  ""Jekyll Island and J.P Morgan"" and you will find the true story.  I hope one day enough people push for change, and it actually happens in my lifetime.  When the people fear the government, then you have no democracy, when the government fears the people, you have true liberty and freedom, which is what was intended more than 200 years ago.
 Good day to all!

On Dec. 23, 1913,¬†President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act. Over the next year, a selection committee made up of Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo, Secretary of Agriculture David Houston, and Comptroller of the Currency John Williams decided which U.S. cities would be a place of residence for one of 12 Federal Reserve District Banks.

The Federal Reserve Banks are¬†not¬†a part of the federal government, but they exist because of an¬†act of Congress. Their purpose is to serve the public. So is the Fed¬†private¬†or¬†public?

The answer is¬†both.¬†While the Board of Governors is an independent government agency, the Federal Reserve Banks are set up like private corporations. Member banks hold stock in the Federal Reserve Banks and earn dividends. 

The¬†U.S. debt¬†¬†reached a new high of $27.9 trillion as of February 26, 2021.

Unlike the trillions of dollars the Treasury is spending to save the economy by bailing out companies or beefing up unemployment checks, very little of the Fed's money actually comes from taxpayers or sales of government bonds. Most of it, in fact, emerges right out of thin air. And that has costs.",t3_mbqknd,2021-03-24 18:24:38,2021-03-24

Use sneakerlinks.com to find what‚Äôs dropping, when and where

Follow ppl like Roszko on YouTube for live cops (he always has good info and helps a bunch every drop)

Then once you secure a sneaker, use Stockx (my preferred) or GOAT app to sell said sneaker without leaving your crib (besides shipping it of course) 

I‚Äôve made $5k since last March spending a grand total of like 20 hours at my computer in all. Super easy tbh and sneakers like Nike Dunks resale for well over 100% profit same day as they release and tend to only go up (few exceptions) 

You can branch out to supreme but you gotta know what you doing with them. 

Best sneakers to get are Nike dunks, Nike sb dunks, Jordan 1s, and collabs involving those 3. 

All will profit just about %100 percent of time . Unless you have no concept of what an ugly shoe looks like you may take a loss or two but if you remove personal preference, it‚Äôll be easy to see what‚Äôll flip. 

For the work put in, it‚Äôs wayyyyy to ez. Don‚Äôt even get me started on botting sneaker sites. 

Stock market too risky and you need decent money to get $100 that quick, sneakers not so much. I just sold a pair today for $240 and paid $105 retail and that‚Äôs shipping too.

Of course that if you buy a Tesla in BTC you are supporting the BTC economy. Tesla will publish the number of people that bought in BTC as well as the Balance Sheet figure and if there is enough demand other companies are going to follow.

What incentive do the governments have to buy Bitcoin for their treasury? I mean as an investment strategy yes I can see the merits, but to adopt it and encourage its use seems counter intuitive. With centralised finance and banks, especially the country I live in which is one you mentioned, the government receive tax from the earnings of the banks (granted not enough but that's another issue altogether) And the central bank is government funded and government run to provide economic stability - something they cannot guarantee if they do not control the currency or if the currency is volatile such as bitcoin can be sometimes. 

I don't like centralised finance, I think it's too open to fraud, misuse by those in power, and manipulation. But those very reasons are the ones I don't think governments will just hope onboard the crypto train. The best we can hope for is that people adopt it and encourage and influence companies like Amazon, Google etc to do it and then in turn leave governments no choice - almost like change from the bottom up.

The first government that moves on this will have the first mover advantage and stands to reap the most benefits. As one goes, the others will follow.

Those that ban it or come last will be part of the new ""developing world"".

Another thing at play for some countries might be the desire to save themselves from their failing currencies.",t3_mc646r,2021-03-24 22:30:05,2021-03-24
3021,gs1wj4d,t1_gs1tf0q,"Fair question. I think OP is actually quite optimistic since the power to create currency and spend before it‚Äôs deflated by the increased supply is imo a big part of what gives government power. I doubt they want to give that up.

That being said, not all fiat currencies are equally strong/beneficial for a country. Because of Foreign exchange rates and such, e.g Venezuela. 

Bitcoin is a democratized, international currency. The supply cant be changed. The only thing that changes is demand. 

Hypothetically, if one country were to buy and hold Bitcoin in their financial reserves obv they would have to buy from the open market meaning demand increases meaning price increases.

Once this happens other countries are likely to consider doing the same, and if a lot of countries were to do this, dominant fiat currencies from today would look like centralized shit coins.

Another point would be that fiat currency always looses purchasing power because of how it‚Äôs created. Bitcoin is like gold as a hedge against inflation with the advantage of having a clear supply schedule, and it doesn‚Äôt weigh as much meaning it doesn‚Äôt need to be stored in a bank. 

Small governments usually put their gold in a bank abroad which gives that bank or the country the bank is in leverage over the country.",t3_mc646r,2021-03-24 22:36:08,2021-03-24
3025,gs1ymaf,t1_gs1vp9r,"That makes sense.

Completely understand about the countries with failing currencies being able to save themselves. I wonder how that would work for the residents of those countries and for their infrastructure as a whole. Because often they're the same people without reliable access to technology and therefore unable manage their money without a trip to the bank or ATM. Lack of physical currency presents additional challenges, however for the economic viability as a whole it would make perfect sense. In one way crypto is democratic af but in other ways not so much. I can see the tech gap existing between residents of first world and third world countries could be an issue. But I'm rambling and thinking out loud.

He claims to hold large bags of bitcoin.  I don't doubt that he does, and that might partially explain his endless promotion on Russia Today and his other platforms.

I'm sure he made a ton out of Maxcoin while others hold the bag now.  You never hear him talk about it now that it's struggling to trade at less than a cent.  It's almost as if the price was the only thing that mattered to him about Maxcoin, not whatever its supposed inherent reason for being was.

Bitcoin attracts a wide range of people, from across social, political and every other kind of spectra, with all sorts of motivation.

When it comes to Maxcoin, the only evidence I need is that he never speaks about it now. If he was promoting Maxcoin because it serves a necessary function, then that should be just as valid now as it was a few years ago, and he should be busy explaining that function and why it's a steal at less than a cent.  But he's not doing that.  He knows the coin was just another random shitcoin to ne pumped and dumped.  And Max has a huge platform to pump from.  He was shilling Maxcoin.  He either made or lost a fortune on it.  I suspect he got out in time to make a fortune.  Of course, if you want to believe that he's still a bagholder for the shitcoin, go for it.
