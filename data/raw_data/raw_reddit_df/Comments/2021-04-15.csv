401,gul571n,t1_gukworl,"Not sure. There are two mechanisms in Lightning channels and payments that increase the privacy of the payments flowing along the network.  I believe they have better anonymizing efficacy then mixing (CoinJoin etc.), but I'm not sure. Here are the mechanisms:

* All information about payment that flow *inside a channel* is only known to the two endpoints. The public blockchain will only contain channel opening/closing info, not anything else.

* **More importantly (this is the big one):** Payments on LN are onion-routed as they hop along the network. Say your payment from A to D follows the path A → B → C → D.  Node C doesn't know the actual origin of the payment, and node B doesn't know the actual destination.",t3_mr8suc,2021-04-15 17:25:39,2021-04-15

The fee of each hop has two parts: a fixed part (nowadays usually 1 satoshi, could be even less), and a proportional part (a percentage of the payment amount).  I believe the proportional fee charged by ACINQ (one of the largest public routing nodes) is around 0.01% (so 1sat per 10,000).",t3_mr8suc,2021-04-15 17:18:07,2021-04-15
428,gulaai0,t1_gul8oyx,"You might keep your lightning wallet for years without needing to close any channels.

Say, you're doing a monthly BTC withdrawal from an exchange for 1 year.

*Scenario 1 (onchain)*: that's 12 onchain transaction fees (with Kraken 15,000 sats fees, that would be 12\*15,000 =  180,000 sats).

*Scenario 2 (LN)*: If instead you're using lightning, that would be 12 sats for the withdrawals (at 1 sat fee per withdrawal). Plus the cost of opening a wallet, getting inbound liquidity (e.g. with Phoenix, 1000 sats for the 1st payment from Kraken), and then transferring to your cold wallet at the end and closing the wallet (e.g. swap-out from Phoenix, fees depending on mempool, not sure how much it would be, say 10,000 sats but probably less); so a total of 11,012 sats.

* Scenario 1 (onchain withdrawls): 180,000 sats (and 12 UTXOs)
* Scenario 2 (ligtning withdrawals): \~ 11,000 sats (and 1 UTXO, so you'd save on fees later)

We make our own laundry detergent, invested in reusables - cloth diapers, rags instead of paper towels, tupperware/silicone bags, bees wax paper, drink water only, cook dinner, pack lunch, say no thanks to daily ""let's go out to lunch"", improved the house to stop paying storage fees, have a tv thats 10 years old, don't buy a phone every 2 years, fix rather than replace (youtube literally has a video for almost every fix), buy used if possible, we have ""dated"" fixtures, our appliances don't match because we replaced only when they died, we didn't renovate because we didn't own anything yet, work out and eat healthy to avoid doctors/medication, change my own car oil/rotate tires, don't buy luxury goods, shop at warehouse clubs, don't have brand loyalty, avoid credit at all costs, avoid ""fashion"" and the list can go on and on. Basically try to avoid being separated from you money at all costs.

It's possible to do if you pay yourself first. 10%+ of what you make, even if $1 a week, it's the key. It doesn't look like much at first but it makes a difference, mentally and physically. I know, inflation and such but it's still better than being caught without any money at all if you need to repair your vehicle.

It's counter intuitive to our culture of consumption above all things but if you can break away from it, it becomes an addiction to try to live simple so you can live large if that makes sense.

I'm not saying this directly at you because I can't possibly know anyone's situation and I understand there are other conditions that can come in to play to prevent some of this but most of what we did was the remedy to remaining in perpetual debt.

I suspect that was due to a misunderstanding about what legal tender actually is. The [meaning](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/what-is-legal-tender) is much narrower than most people realise.

While he is technically correct; a claim that is never settled is the same as a new unit of currency.

Another problem with his theory is that the central bank is perfectly willing to print new central bank money on demand if it has to ; to match m1/2/3. 

Money, fundamentally and conceptually, is an illusion. The bubble is the reality. Its a communications network powered by a belief system. and that belief system is reinforced by nothing but its own history. 

Due to that, the bubbled up accounts of debt that fill everyone's bank accounts are just as real as accounts at the fed. Maybe more real. Fiat works differently than bitcoin; it can really be minted/printed on the spot by a very large number of semi-centralized agencies. And most of the time, the central bank will back their actions.

So to talk precisely, fiat M2 is probably the best analogue for what the bitcoin supply represents, and should be compared to to determine the relative use of each network.",t3_mqq1id,2021-04-14 23:59:16,2021-04-14

The miners providing hash power from all around the world form an analogous network, and they serve as the payment processors and curators of the network alongside node operators and the bitcoin core teams, who all sync the network for individual wallet-holders, with soon-to-be upgrades such as Lightning, which will only further resemble traditional processors like VISA in terms of off-chain settlement, much like transferring pounds from one bank account to another.

I have heard of these countries, it was rhetorical but I didn't mind if anyone took it literal because that wasn't the point, the point was that these countries are typically unheard of, why would they be ranked so high?   


I think we are attributing the wrong status to bitcoin because this list is a bit different than I imagine someone would think it is.    


Looking at the OP image you would think the UK currency is 6th best in the world, but the op doesn't post the list he is refering too, or any article, this is just some image with no credibility, you're left to look it up yourself and what I found that relates is that list is no where near the impression I got when I looked at the first image, so just what exactly is this a list of?    


Well the market cap of the united states is  30,436,313,000,000 (30 trillion), and we use USD in our country, USD is also quite popular everywhere else, so, why would USD not be on that list?   


read this, it's about the list I posted ""You will receive just 0.30 Kuwait dinar after exchanging 1 US dollar, making the Kuwaiti dinar the world's highest-valued currency unit per face value, or simply 'the world's strongest currency'.""  I'm assuming that means we're referring to how low that number can go... this does not determine the stability of a currency against other countries, it just shows how much they don't print / inflate their money as much as other countries have, or that they're new currencies who have yet to inflate their currency through printing and bailing out banks and what not.   


Infact this whole thing leads you into a trap, because you google this and you think oh shit he's right and you just overlook the fact that the first 4-5 countries make zero sense to give praise too.

Paypal accepts it kinda. They'll charge you an exchange rate higher than any exchange so they can make money, which you won't know how much until you go to make the transaction, plus service fees of course. But they won't let you refund it bc crypto purchases are nonrefundable.

So sure if you want to pay more than it would cost in dollars and have less protections like being able to refund the item, paypal will accept it.

In this way I could see it being compared to a foreign currency. The big difference being that foreign currency does actually have a geographical place where it is legal tender.

I can pull out at any time if something seems fishy or the interest rates drop to a point where I deem it's no longer worth the risk, but for now the interest is actually pretty significant in helping stacking more sats and I quite like their scheduled purchase automation

I use them for my weekly DCA purchases

It's increased risk, but it's risk that (for now) I'm willing to accept

3706,gulitas,t3_mrazb2,"You have to be pretty savvy about crypto to even know what Satoshis are.  At this point Bitcoin is the brand and trying to rename how it is discussed or denominated is likely to just create confusion and uncertainty.  That said, I agree that in the absence of that issue it would be helpful.  I know I find it slightly discouraging to look at a small buy and see all those zeros behind the decimal point.",t3_mrazb2,2021-04-15 20:31:19,2021-04-15
3707,gulu8l2,t3_mrazb2,"I think there needs to be a different denomination. I mean, I have 0.02 something of a bitcoin. And that equals millions of Satoshis. That's crazy.

You see, it doesn't make sense. the basic unit of count in bitcoin should be the transfer fee. so it only makes sense to own multiples of the transfer fee, otherwise you will never be able to move your coins.",t3_mrazb2,2021-04-15 22:34:30,2021-04-15
