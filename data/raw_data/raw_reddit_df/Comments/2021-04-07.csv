Ukraine isn't halfway done. 

Ukraine is below average currently. 

If a country is 5% of the population and they own less than 5% of the total supply of Bitcoin, then that country is already fucked. 

As time goes by, and the price of Bitcoin goes exponential, it becomes harder and harder faster and faster to get up to an average Bitcoin ownership. This is true on every scale, individual all the way up to nations. 

21 million BTC divided by 8 billion people is ₿0.0023 per person. The longer you wait to attain this, the more it'll cost you to do so. Today it would cost $130. For the next generation, it'll cost more than a house. 

This is also true on the nation scale. 

Looking through this perspective, Ukraine is already fucked when it comes to Bitcoin. They need to step up their game in other words. Abandoning Bitcoin is the most losing strategy possible.",t3_mlzr4x,2021-04-07 22:29:14,2021-04-07

Those with money on exchanges would panic sell to fiat and those trying to move coins to an exchange to sell would keep paying higher and higher fees to hopefully get into the next block which would be found at best every 20 minutes and more likely every 30.

Regardless of a persons belief in the future or ‘vision’ of Bitcoin, the China centralisation is a massive risk.

Another scenario is China is temporarily cut off from the rest of the world; when they rejoin they have the longer chain and our chain is discarded and all spends reversed.

. . .  

THE PRICE SUPPRESSION MECHANICS OF GLD & SLV

The bullion banks finance their ‘physical inventory’ by leasing it or selling it to GLD and SLV shareholders/investors, then the bullion banks in turn use these ETF’s inventories as a ‘flywheel’ to both manage and leverage their physical reserves. For this walk-through, I will use GLD as an example. (One can substitute SLV for all that is described below relating to GLD except the basket sizes are smaller, constituting 50,000 shares).

Baskets of GLD shares are bought and sold through a limited number of Authorised Participants. The authorised participants, (AP’s), are JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Newedge (a joint venture between Société Générale and Credit Agricole CIB), RBC, Scotia Mocatta, UBS and Virtu Financial. This is how it is supposed to work. The size of each GLD basket comprises of 100,000 shares, each share representing just less than 1 troy oz. The AP’s, transfer ALLOCATED physical gold to the trustee who in turn creates the required number of new baskets of shares and then transfers these newly created shares back to the AP. To redeem the shares for physical gold or silver, the AP’s transfer any number of the baskets of 100,000 shares back to the trustee who then redeems these shares and transfers allocated gold back to the AP.

This is all well and good on the face of it, but there are a number of ways this ‘allocated’ gold backing the shares in the ETF can be diluted /hypothecated in order for the bullion banks to ‘manage’ their physical reserves.

If, as is often the case, there is insufficient allocated inventory available to the bullion bank at the current Comex driven & discounted spot fix price to create the necessary new GLD shares backed by allocated gold, then it is possible for a bullion bank to borrow short these GLD shares from the ETF instead of providing the required Allocated physical to the trustee to meet this obligation thereby ‘fly wheeling’ this physical demand in order to meet obligations elsewhere, likely at the day’s gold fix. This obviously has the effect of manipulating price lower vs. the true immediate supply demand fundamentals as no allocated physical metal has to be bought on the open market at that days fix to meet this new share demand as should be the case.

This is now the point where transparency evaporates. The AP claims to be Short GLD while concurrently claiming to be backing it with an equal size long ‘UNALLOCATED’ spot gold position. However, LBMA unallocated gold accounts are run upon a fractional reserve requirement and leveraged around 100/1 so there is very little need to back this transaction with any real physical at this point; this is left until later as explained below. To unwind this short GLD position, the bullion bank has to ALLOCATE the required amount of unallocated gold and then transfer this gold back to the trustee thereby receiving back the required # of shares in order to repay the original GLD shares sold short.

However, in conjunction with concurrent concentrated short futures positions, the sole object of this entire charade is to assist in depressing the price of gold at times of strong physical demand so that the futures price can be capped, usually at key inflection points where the price would break out and also swamp the very large concentrated Comex short positions. If this were not the case, the bullion bank would simply bid up that days fix price until it reflected that days true supply demand price levels for that fix and provide allocated gold to meet this real demand at that higher price.

The resulting distortion now created between the real and paper market price is exacerbated through the use of heavy position concentration and leverage in the futures and derivatives markets, where these very same bullion banks then seek to profitably repay the shorted GLD shares at a lower price at the point at or below where the lines cross profitably. This then puts these bullion banks in a position to finally spot index UNALLOCATED gold against this naked short position only then moving to buy the now discounted unallocated gold into the Comex contrived dips. These discounted unallocated long spot index positions are then ALLOCATED at the upcoming fix, enabling both the repayment of the GLD short position at a profit but most importantly controlling the rise in price against much larger derivative positions elsewhere.

In fact, you’ll notice ETFs have been related to the top of a cycle (hence the upward price pressure). Let me quickly review what price drops and increases are just for a quick refresher. 

Historically, price drops have been associated with the downward movement of a line on a chart. A good example of this is the dot com bubble or the 2008 financial crisis. Usually when the line goes down, that’s bad. I believe the opposite is true for the BTC ETF, that is, that ETF’s will propel this line upwards (the opposite of downwards) to the top of the bull cycle.
