Invisible inflation will become visible with the rise in prices of basic necessities. Owning a house is already out of reach for many. 

When critical mass of people refuse to accept their wages in monopoly money is when the scam ends. They will start demanding to be paid in money that stores value and increases in value over time. Money will become an asset, a savings account and a medium of exchange.

Assets shouldn‚Äôt be sold unless it‚Äôs to buy another asset of greater worth. You take loans out because loans are cheap, against the increasing value of the asset.

It‚Äôs why whale Bitcoin holders continued to grow larger over the years. Because accumulating the worlds apex asset is a no brainer. You don‚Äôt offload assets. You accumulate them. 

You only dispose them if you‚Äôre legit old and retired. Which to be honest I doubt most bitcoiners are old.

If the price really goes to 280k this year, you'll win big. Even if the price crashes down 85% from there, it would drop to 42k but it would drop there gradually and reach that low far later than 12 months from now.

So on average, I'd expect you to earn significantly more in USD terms because BTC will probably be above today's price for the entire next 12 months.

Add to that that a 85% drop is quite unlikely this time, so let's say it's a 60% - that would 112k which is still more than today.",t3_mixp15,2021-04-03 10:20:56,2021-04-03

1237,gt7qrm8,t3_mixp15,"I am trying to wrap my head around this negotiation to see how it differs from receiving cash and buying bitcoin with every paycheck.

Essentially OP has made an agreement to buy BTC with 100% of their paycheck for 12 months at a fixed price. The ""100% of their paycheck"" is the part people are concerned with (For good reason) but ignoring this, if we pretend they are working purely for investment purposes, does it make more sense than buying with cash?

Ignore OP's savings week to week, we can assume 100% of income is saved and always as BTC for this example.

In essence, OP has taken a 0% loan for one year's salary and put it all into BTC, where they are locked in but get a weekly allowance to withdrawal proportional to the percentage of time elapsed since the loan began. 

I assume there are penalties if you leave this company within your 12 month negotiation, however if there are not, OP may have made a smart financial move.

No penalties mean just that, you took out a loan to buy BTC but if it goes to $0 you're not on the hook to pay it all back, you walk away and only lose the value you've been given through your weekly ""Allowance"" thus far. (You lose what you've worked for)

In the bullish scenario, OP is making gains on the full annual amount but can only realize the percentage of BTC matching the percentage of 12 months they've worked. (Keep working to keep taking gains off the table)

If I'm understanding this right the only thing making this a bad idea is that OP says they're going all in. Otherwise it sounds like a 0% loan you can walk away from if it gets bad early on. Am I missing anything?",t3_mixp15,2021-04-03 12:16:59,2021-04-03

Imagine a small employer locking up $80k of their working capital in a relatively volatile asset for *a year*, that they:

1. Get no upside on, but entirely face the risk exposure to a downturn.

2. Can't use those funds for other business purposes in the interim.

3. Can't even invest in the interim.

4. Complicates their taxes, reporting requirements, and possible employment law issues. OP can do what he wants with his income, but employers have legal requirements to meet. If the btc rate, for example, fell below minimum wage, the employment may not even be legal anymore.

Either üëâ this tale is bs üëà or the employer actually eats crayons.

**Edit ‚Äì** For those not understanding the negative-only risk exposure part:

If BTC moons, OP completes the contract and gets yummy tendies. Employer gets no upside.

If BTC tanks, OP would dogshit the remainder of the contract because he's not going to work ten more months for nothing. \*Employer is stuck holding the bag on the loss.",t3_mixp15,2021-04-03 13:39:18,2021-04-03

* If BTC tanks, OP is going to dogshit the remainder of the contract because he's not going to work ten more months for nothing. [Employer gets fucked by any downturn.]

* If BTC moons, OP still performs the same level of work as usual. [Employer doesn't share in any of the upside.]

A short-term contract denominated in bitcoin is totally feasible, but with BTC still pretty volatile, only an actual crayon eater employer would buy $80k of bitcoin today and hold that risk for a year with no upside to them.

It doesn't make sense for an employer to eat this extra risk for no upside. It's like a year-duration covered call to OP for $0 fee.

--

It would also lock up all that capital that the company could be making interest on in the interim or using for other business purposes. OP is a phony or employer is big dumb.

--

Maybe OP could be pseudo lying. He might have simply done what you said ‚Äî invested an amount of his own money similar to the contract value, and his future salary reimburses that ""loan"".

If you think BTC will increase another 20% then it‚Äôs worth taking even a 10% cut in salary even with the chance at a 1% bonus.

Say he makes $100k normally. Now he gets $90k in BTC. If BTC goes up 20% he‚Äôs looking at $108k vs his $101k normal salary, almost 7% more money. 

And I‚Äôm betting, hell many people are betting BTC goes up much more than 20% vs USD.

Lets say in 5 years BTC is at $500k (conservative estimate), you earn ~5% interest on your BTC with something like Celsius, so you earn $25k a year in interest. So 1 coin might be enough for a frugal lifestyle, but considering cost of living increases and things like supporting a family, etc, you might need 3 or 4.

Then along comes this magical free market fairy of bitcoin. The peoples store of value. Perfect digital sound money. It solves the problem in several important ways. It was introduced fairly. It distributes wealth to early adopters who could've been anyone, and it introduces a sound money that will gradually and with market principles, gradually and safely unwind the housing bubbles, college loan bubbles and frankly the stock market bubble. It will restore long term sanity to fiscal policy and keep fiat currencies honest.

We are so lucky to have bitcoin. Not just because it's an opportunity for financial freedom for our families, but because of what it will do to the existing unfair economic system.

2663,gt7s57x,t3_mj0zil,"It's always possible that another cryptocurrency could overtake bitcoin as #1, but there's only one altcoin that currently exists that I think could possibly do that and I doubt it happens. **Another cryptocurrency could always be created and possibly overtake bitcoin one day**, but bitcoin is currently the most secure, most decentralized, most valuable, most adopted, and most fairly launched cryptocurrency that is currently in existence, and it also has the biggest infrastructure and user base.

Over 99% of **altcoins were created to enrich their founders** and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Satoshi **created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else**. Satoshi and bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer fund, no developer tax, never sold, no profit, no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, no leader, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their [ethereum stack if they don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&feature=youtu.be). **Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run**, but you can also lose bitcoin. Bitcoin is also decentralized and trustless with the nodes in full control, and there's no central leader.

**Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:**

* **Bitcoin didn't have a premine** (Satoshi didn‚Äôt grant himself any coins)

* **Satoshi gave a 2 month heads up before launching bitcoin** (no secret mining or sudden release)

* **Bitcoins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely** (this cannot even be replicated)

* **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet that it never happens again)

Satoshi created bitcoin for the world and he never even cashed out. He did it for us and he didn't even profit from it. It's truly amazing and it's 100% impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating in the wild freely for 18 months before having any value. I also don't think that we'll ever see another cryptocurrency created where the founder never cashes out. It's also decentralized with the nodes in full control and there's no central leader, which is probably why he left us, because it was best for bitcoin's success. No premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, never sold, no profit, no fame for his real identity, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched bitcoin. Everyone altcoiner has Satoshi to thank for all of the cryptocurrencies that even exist. Satoshi paved the way and it's impossible for anyone to ever replicate the exact way that he launched bitcoin because the genie is out of the bottle and cryptocurrency now exists.

The latest version of bitcoin is still just 0.21.0 and the technology is constantly being developed. We're switching to schnorr signatures this year and taproot is getting activated. We've got the lightning network, various sidechains like the liquid network, new discreet log contracts, and we should also have trustless cross chain atomic swaps late this year. 

Bitcoin's blockchain is layer 1 and is used for large payments/settlements/transactions and the lightning network is one of bitcoin's layer 2 solutions and it's used for smaller instant payments/transactions. People are transferring $500M+ worth of bitcoin, half the time over a $billion worth of bitcoin, [in every single block](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks), all day, every day. The lightning network allows an unlimited amount of users to send/receive bitcoin instantly for almost no fees.

2) Time.  Time in existence is important, as it gives people certainty in the security and power of the technology and the network.

2701,gt86lma,t3_mj0zil,"Let's compare ETH and BTC. I'm fans of both, but think they serve different purposes

&#x200B;

BTC is just focused on separating money from the state. It's purpose is to be a functioning currency globally.

&#x200B;

ETH is smart contracts (""Better underlying tech""). However, that better tech comes at the cost of a much more bloated blockchain. This makes node operating much less common. Most ETH nodes are pruned and are at 200GB, but the unpruned nodes that store the entire blockchain are > 3TB. BTC Total blockchain is 300GB.

&#x200B;

But that's fine, you get DEX and smart contracts and decentralized web apps out of ETH. However, it's also because of those use cases I find it weird ETH is switching to PoS and becoming half deflationary half inflationary based. All of that encourages people to hold, but then that means less money flows to the actual use cases of the currency...

&#x200B;

It would cost more than the value of Bitcoin to create a network as secure and still have it provide the same function of a distributed trust-less and permanent ledger. Bitcoin is the king of massive SHA-256 transaction networks and you‚Äôd need hundreds of billions of dollars to build a competitor. Bitcoin had first mover advantage that came with an infrastructural investment advantage. 

This is similarly why both ETH and LTC are basically kings of their encryption protocols too. The mining apparatus for SHA-256 is built for Bitcoin, the mining apparatus for ECDSA is built for Ethereum and the mining apparatus for Scrypt is built for Litecoin. And the vast majority of those mining apparatuses still work towards securing the coin they were built for. As such they‚Äôre all pretty safe from true long term competition.

Also let‚Äôs not forget the fact that if there is remotely enough political will to get a extra transcontinental highway, you could probably simply use that will to upgrade the existing one. Bitcoin, LiteCoin and Ethereum arguably have the strongest and most stable networks but they aren‚Äôt unchangeable. If a truly innovative and needed upgrade gets proposed and the vast majority of people want it, then it will be implemented. How do you think we got Segwit? And that wasn‚Äôt even with a full consensus from the greater community. And our scaling solution lightning network even allows smart contracts so DeFi isn‚Äôt even impossible.

An email from John Gilmore reports an average of 30 messages a day from December 1, 1996 to March 1, 1999, and suggests that the number was probably higher earlier.[5] The number of subscribers is estimated to have reached 2000 in the year 1997

With this technology, however, its unlikely anything can be 100 times better in every way, because there are fundamental trade offs.

I'm coming to the realisation that anything built on Ethereum is either very risky or should be seen as a hobby. These things need to be proven for years before the vast majority of people can trust them. Most people are way better off going with a far less risky traditional service until the algorithms are battle tested. And that isn't even taking into consideration the move to Eth 2.0 or layer 2 protocols.

I'm only picking on Ethereum here because of its relative popularity, but the same attitude should be applied to any other decentralised system.

There is also Bitcoin's brand and simple message, which people understand it. Other networks are taking about decentralising everything, smart contracts, defi and Web 3.0. Those are all relatively complex ideas, while Hodl and Stack Sats is really simple.",t3_mj0zil,2021-04-03 20:49:07,2021-04-03

Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an ""initial coin offering."" They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).

Vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness."" 

The ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated in cryptocurrency, but there is no persistence of a singular narrative and ethereum is still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.

Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 

The inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ETH is decentralized. Meanwhile Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH while still following the rules of the smart contract. So Vitalik rolled back the entire blockchain because ethereum is centralized and Vitalik can do whatever he wants. He named the real ethereum blockchain as ethereum classic and calls his rolled back chain ethereum. ETH miners also recently said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so King Vitalik called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. Vitalik can only control ethereum because it's centralized and Vitalik can do whatever he wants.

The fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations, unlike holding bitcoin. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.

Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon and I have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.

The fact is, **ethereum is a centralized scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes** (how many ERC20 pyramid scamcoins run on top of ethereum again?), **but it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive premine.**

Now I'm going to talk about the current ethereum hype which is NFTs. NFTs can be done on bitcoin using colored coins, and they were actually done on bitcoin first, before ethereum ecen existed lol but bitcoin is already doing something that's actually important. NFTs have some actual uses but what people doing with them right now isn't one of them. [It costs anywhere from $70-$500+ to mint an NFT on ethereum](https://www.supercryptonews.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-mint-an-nft/) depending on where you do it, so they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are blowing millions of dollars worth of ETH minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.

What these stupid NFTs are is just a cryptographic hash on the ethereum blockchain that points to the location of an image on the internet. That's all they are doing. People are buying URLs because it's too expensive to actually store the image on ethereum, so they're just buying a pointer to the location of it on the internet lol and that pointer is on the ethereum blockchain. The server storing the image has no obligation to continue storing it and you don't own the image. You just own the hash that points to it.",t3_mj0zil,2021-04-03 13:47:06,2021-04-03

2808,gt8xrt5,t1_gt8vxyu,"Your are probably right they will market it that way. I don't mean to be an asshole but any ""new coin"" has no right to exist until it proves a good reason. I don't agree with this attitude of ""hey its a funky crypto revolution man, plenty of room for everyone."" No, bitcoin blazed a trail, blaze your own fucking trail.

2810,gt8o6cm,t1_gt8je75,"Totally disagree?  Okay.  Why?

Why is it not a scam?

This guy did a ton of work and provided facts.  What did you provide besides blindness?

If your post was changed to a color identifying insight, where the brightest colors = insight, your post would be a black box.",t3_mj0zil,2021-04-03 20:48:35,2021-04-03

2813,gt8zs6d,t1_gt8xrt5,"Not an asshole opinion that is definitely how the crypto market works. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbacked‚Äù by anything so coins have to prove their worth somehow. That would be the difference in a government coin though, it is backed by the government. Considering Tesla is already allowed to accept Bitcoin it doesn‚Äôt seem like the government will try to compete. It just seems like they‚Äôd make you convert from BTC to gov coin to buy things once paper money is finally put to bed",t3_mj0zil,2021-04-03 22:48:29,2021-04-03

2828,gt88qbz,t3_mj4osn,Ya P2P with anons who message you on Reddit isn‚Äôt a good idea. Answering random pm‚Äôs on Reddit in general tbh,t3_mj4osn,2021-04-03 16:45:59,2021-04-03
2829,gt8emth,t3_mj4osn,Your fault for not getting her. One minute of looking into her post history and there's a post from a month ago with someone saying she's a scammer on multiple subs.,t3_mj4osn,2021-04-03 18:32:40,2021-04-03
2830,gt8gdob,t3_mj4osn,"I can't say I have much sympathy in all honesty. Trusting a stranger on the internet, especially when money is involved. Is never a good idea. I'm no scammer, but you're lucky she isn't that bright. As if I was them. I would have just sent you $20 to gain trust. So when you ended up sending me more Crypto, I would have got more out of you. Learn from your mistake and be lucky you only lost $20.",t3_mj4osn,2021-04-03 19:01:52,2021-04-03
2831,gt8lcqt,t3_mj4osn,"Not a good idea to trust random strangers but imagine creating a whole Reddit persona for 20 bucks. There have to be a million easier ways to get $20. Hell id go to a casino first before going for a long Reddit con just to get 20 fucken dollars. Fucks sake Kathleen, you couldn‚Äôt see how fucken short sited this was?
