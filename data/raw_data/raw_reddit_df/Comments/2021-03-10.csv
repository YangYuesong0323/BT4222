Could you clarify?

Also, if you work for Braiins, I wanted to mention that its SUPER annoying that the subscribe popup comes up every 60 seconds. Even after you subscribe, it keeps coming up. Please fix that if you work there.

A separate question: I've heard job negotiation is optional when using V2. Is that true? Why not make job negotiation a requirement of v2 (once it becomes possible)?",t3_m16uon,2021-03-10 04:27:38,2021-03-10

26,gqdm1e0,t1_gqdb02h,"The changes to Bitcoin Core aren't actually for the Job Negotiation sub-protocol itself but rather the Template Distribution sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks in the first place. The Template Distribution Protocol is designed to replace getblocktemplate with something much more efficient and easy to implement.

Good question on making it voluntary. Adoption of V2 itself is voluntary (miners can always just keep using V1), so making Job Negotiation involuntary may hinder adoption in general. From a miner's perspective, switching to V2 for the main mining protocol is as easy as putting a V2 pool url in their firmware configuration, a 2-second task. On the other hand, Job Negotiation requires them to run a full node and to implement a proxy service in between their miners and their pool(s). Many miners today don't run nodes, so having that requirement may just serve as an unintentional barrier to widespread V2 adoption. 

Hope that answers your questions, let me know if not and I'll try to get some further info from the devs.

But it sounds like getblocktemplate was already designed with this use case in mind. So is the idea that its not worth implementing stratum v2 using getblocktemplate? Or is there some specific part of stratum v2's template distribution that getblocktemplate doesn't support?

40,gqg2e9f,t1_gqdow3v,"Trying to add some clarity to the reply my colleague posted from Jan below...

The Template Distribution Protocol allows miners / mining pools to queue up multiple block templates for the *next* block in the chain after the one being worked on presently (i.e. current block height +2) ahead of time, that way when a block is found the miners can begin working on a full block right away instead of everybody starting on an empty block. We have a more in-depth description of this here: [https://braiins.com/blog/why-pools-mine-empty-blocks-and-how-stratum-v2-fixes-this](https://braiins.com/blog/why-pools-mine-empty-blocks-and-how-stratum-v2-fixes-this)",t3_m16uon,2021-03-10 22:03:41,2021-03-10

""One aspect that current getblocktemplate is not suitable for is providing an alternative template to the current one that contains the next batch of TX's with lower prio that the current ones being mined. This is to improve the 'empty block mining' use case as we refer to/explain on the stratum V2 web page.

As to exact fields that are missing/different between getblock template and our template distribution protocol I would have to look. The difference is also that the templates would be streamed by core so that you don't have to query it - gimme a new one, gimme a new one etc.""",t3_m16uon,2021-03-10 19:50:01,2021-03-10

Once these nations stop respecting the dollar and start rejecting the dollar, they will start opting out of the ponzi scheme causing first inflation and then hyper-inflation of the USD.

When this happens, the USD Ponzi scheme will collapse and people in the USA (and around the world) will be f----d in the ass.

...  
 But as soon as the trend turns upwards, ...

Personally, I don't subscribe so much to the conspiracy theories that are bandied about around here so often, that the media writes what their ""masters"" tell them to write to achieve an agenda (well, they do that too, of course). I think in this case the explanation is much simpler:

They are click-bait chasers. Plain and simple. They write what generates clicks. And they copy from each other if they smell even the slightest whiff of a click-bait-bandwagon they can jump on.

An article about the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and why it has promise even though the price is currently going down, would require actual work. A simple regurgitation of the latest FUD is much quicker to write and fits the picture of the ""falling price"" much better, to generate clicks. The same fud-rehashing articles however are boring while Bitcoin is doing well. So they instead jump on press-releases and similar stuff, where companies or billionaires or celebrities announce an ""audacious"" jump into this ""new and exciting sector"".",t3_m1v8ls,2021-03-10 20:22:12,2021-03-10

Janet Yellen first made those comments and then Bitcoin started to drop. She made those comments because she saw Bitcoin climbing really fast, which could trigger a small problem and imbalance in financial markets. Then, the financial media companies joined because they are owned by financial market players.

Janet Yellen comments were spammed all over this sub because there was a concerted effort from day traders to manipulate the price in the direction that suits them and to create volatility so they can profit. Traders do not want stable price Bitcoin. They make money when there's volatility.

You need to understand and filter all these factors.

Additionally, as you pointed out, there are institutions (owned by these guys) who are trying to enter the crypto space, so they want the price to lag a bit in order for them to fund themselves at a low price.

Big clue - you don't. Just like you don't know if someone puts a big sticker on their expensive car that says ""hold your gold at your house Don't put it in a bank!"" That they wouldn't be targeted by a thief.

You are presuming that the people who would do the kidnapping are coherent rational actors. That makes you a irrational incoherent actor.

So many people have regrets with not handling crypto the way they would handle it today, but that's hindsight and you can't beat yourself up over it. It was a strange new thing - and it still is! 


I thought of getting in back in 2014 but I couldn't grasp the concept AT ALL and figured it was a bubble/scam bc the guy that told me about it was a halfwit. I had opportunity to get into it for several years and the topic came up again last September as I needed a place to put $50,000 come October. If I had put it in bitcoin last fall that would be $200,000 today.

2291,gqenzsp,t1_gqeg7gj,"They're valid arguments from the very early days that have been addressed extensively over the years. The energy argument is overblown and hyped by media in every bull cycle for the last 8 years, in my experience. [Here's a good piece on this from 2019](https://unchained-capital.com/blog/bitcoin-does-not-waste-energy/).

The scalability argument for on-chain Bitcoin transactions has also been hotly debated from the very first launch of the network. Currently it can only do 7 transactions per second, compared to 4000 or more per second for the likes of VISA. But what most people don't understand is that Bitcoin doesnt make transactions but actual *settlements* with probablistic finality, and *with no third party* involved. This is what makes it so revolutionary. VISA settles with their clearning houses in a time frame of days/weeks, therefore making transactions reversible. Bitcoin transactions are like giving a dollar bill to a person, once it changes hands, you can't just ask for it back. The scalability of Bitcoin for global usage will be on Layer 2 applications like Lightning Network (can handle millions of transactions per second and transfers in seconds without a middleman) and even centralized services like Paypal, Cash app (they now allow Bitcoin transfers). Bitcoin layer 1 (main blockchain) is already able to settle hundreds of billions of dollars daily today.

I can make a million dollar transfer right now, anytime I want, to anyone with a bitcoin address, anywhere in the world, without permission from anyone, my transaction cannot be stopped or reversed, with reasonable privacy/no one montioring my transaction, and it will be settled with finality once it gets confirmed and written on the blockchain, in 10 minutes to 1 hour. The world seems to agree that there's a lot of value in that, hence Bitcoin has a $1 trillion market cap in just 11 years.",t3_m1a9z3,2021-03-10 11:15:54,2021-03-10

2306,gqe3v3r,t1_gqdeyxa,"Not entirely true. You have always been able to choose how much you pay for fees, including 0. Miners can include any valid transaction they want on their block. However, as they get to keep the fees and the number of transactions per block is capped, they will include the highest fee transactions first. That is why sending a transaction with lower fee takes longer to be included in a block. So if you send a transaction with fee 0, a miner may choose to include it. I know because some years ago I sent a 0 fee transaction and it eventually got confirmed. In those times there were not so many transactions though so I am not sure if it would work today.",t3_m1a9z3,2021-03-10 08:15:25,2021-03-10
