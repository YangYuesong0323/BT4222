6,gpy9h7o,t3_lz0gl9,"I like this line of reasoning. Wasn't a fan of the LOT proposal because it seems like using the nuclear option too soon, especially on an uncontentious upgrade.

12,gpxqkki,t3_lz0gl9,"this is no good at all.

in case the miners cooperate this brings taproot with 6 months delay which is anacceptable

at least there should be 2 different types of signalling A and B: if A gets to 90% it is activated immediately, if A + B gets to 90% it is activated in 6 months

anyways LOT=False is just fine, LOT=True is even better",t3_lz0gl9,2021-03-06 20:25:59,2021-03-06
18,gpxs4h9,t1_gpxqkki,"SPDY8 is faster than BIP8 LOT=false or BIP8 LOT=true in the default case that miners activate.  the delay is not ""wasted"" because you really do want power users, exchanges, wallets and pools/miners to actually upgrade their nodes.  and they are often somewhat slow on that, the post activation period is time for them to do that, which is kind of needed to justify the faster activation window.  otherwise you get a situation like with BIP66 where miners activated a soft-fork but weren't actually running the code which led to an accidental temporary fork.",t3_lz0gl9,2021-03-06 20:31:53,2021-03-06
24,gpy1eo7,t1_gpxs4h9,"well, I recall cltv softfork which was shipped and activated in 3 months and all was well and fine

I agree that schnorr is a more impacting change and I agree as well on the importance to have PowerUsers upgrading their nodes, but in case of problems you will see them flock to the new software as fast as they could.

as problematic a split could be for bitcoin imagine how catastrophic would be for an exchange or a Bitcoin related business.

it's not gonna happen and in case it happens, well another ground test to prove bitcoin's antifragility and resilience in distressing environments.

a posteriori it would be as good as resisting the s2x attack

at least cut short the waiting time to 3 months, not 6",t3_lz0gl9,2021-03-06 21:21:54,2021-03-06
30,gpy4b4h,t1_gpy1eo7,"i think lock-in is 6mo total from release not from activation, but this is still a proposal and code review takes time also.  you have to see how persistently slow and lazy the majority of ecosystem players are.  it's like a near immovable force of inertia.  some infamous examples still don't have batching nor segwit, would you believe.  it's not all recalcitrance (tho some of it absolutely is in a few cases) but also because businesses have a lot of legacy code and they can get scared to touch it in case it breaks, plus under resourced, and too many things to cope with that are always ""higher priority"".",t3_lz0gl9,2021-03-06 21:35:25,2021-03-06

193,gpykruc,t1_gpyfnja,"Long story but

Used to teach private English lessons to a Korean lad. Late 20s early 30s. He was neck deep in something called 'OneCoin'. First time we met he said he needed English lessons to help him understand it more. I asked him what it was and he said 'Have you heard of Bitcoin?'. I said yeah (but didn't own any at the time). He said it was like that but better.

Anyway I got home to do some research before our first lesson and after three minutes on google I know it was a pyramid scheme. 

Met to discuss the first lesson and I told him 'Sorry I can't help you with this'. Stopped short of calling it a scam but told him it wasnt something I wanted to get involved in. He told me (more or less) I didn't need to worry about that, and just help him with his English. 

I later found out he was in this thing to the tune of 10,000 dollars or more. I then found out he'd sold the same 'product' to his sister. And his mother.

He moved to Seoul to marry some instagram twot maybe a year later and stopped seeing him. Realized later that sadly my English lessons were probably helping him dress up and sell his 'investment' to other victims. On more than one occasion I thought that the English lessons were actually sales pitches and he was trying to talk me into putting my own money in. Him and his mother met my girlfriend (at the time) and her mother for dinner (they already knew eachother) and mostly tried to talk to them about what an exciting investment opportunity one coin was.

This was about early to mid 2017. A lot of that was going on at the time. People thought they missed the train and were trying to jump in on the next pennies-to-riches story. Ripple was the same.

The sad thing is if all those people had just bought bitcoin they would have still been so early, ended up making bank. The sadder thing is this guy wasn't an idiot.

Dont know what the guy is doing now but OneCoin is still listed as his job on Facebook, and he got involved in some other fishy looking MLM thing called Wonder7 too.

Fences and military are there to protect this posessions. (Zhey are failing since the invention of nuclear weapons.

The facts are NOTHING IS EVER EQUAL.  Some have more money, some have more intellect, some have more drive, some have talents in basketball and others have talent in WSB.  But the lie of communism is that everything is equal if we surrender to the State.  They will control everything for us if we just do what they say.

In Wuhan China the doors to apartments were welded shut to prevent the people from getting out.  Fauci worked with Wuhan in the development of the Covid 19 (FOIA Judicial Watch), your communities were locked down with the government saying who could stay in business and who could not.

The Great Reset is to do away with free open markets, nationalities, language, money (BitCoin), a sense of self and turn everything over to the globalists who will direct everything you do.  Look at China-One Road policy of world domination.  They are ruining the African countries, stripping their resources, domination of the populations.

Today, I received an email that SlushPool was purchased by another company. That notice revealed an old email address I had used to create my account with them. I was able to use that email address to reset my password.

Today that <$1 is worth C$243, and I was able to withdraw it, because the minimum withdraw rate is now only 0.001 BTC (and I had 0.004 BTC mined).

The debt:GDP ratio is fine for now. I've also noticed that some people seem to think that the mining process being so resource-intensive somehow adds intrinsic value to bitcoin.  It doesn't.  Mining Bitcoin and creating USD are the same act, i.e. money creation.  Bitcoin just costs a whole lot more to create.  However, monetary policy can do that, too.  Don't forget that a lot of people are becoming more attracted to bitcoin now because we are living in such bizarre and uncertain times--and online, lol.

1437,gpvfba7,t1_gpupq7n,"That’s true enough, but BTC doesn’t exactly grow at a consistent rate. It tends to hover around a certain price for a couple years, shoot up exponentially in value within a year/few months, then gradually settle to a new (higher) baseline.  We’re in the “shoot up” stage right now — even considering the ongoing correction — but it’s unclear just how much more fuel this run has left. I think it still has a lot of room to grow, though it’s certainly possible that we’ve already passed the peak.

I was just looking at the price action of BTC over time earlier today, here’s what I saw starting in 2012. Its average price in 2012 was $8.26, then it shoots up to $200 in early 2013, $1,200 by late 2013 early 2014. Price falls more slowly to $270 in 2015, then gradually climbs back up to the $750 range by 2016, just below the ATH from two years prior. End of phase 1. Support was in the $200s, resistance around $1.2k, fair value $500.

Phase two starts with 2017’s explosive growth from ~$1k to $20,000 by the beginning of 2018. Price more gradually drops to the $3-5k range by late 2018/early 2019, then it slowly climbs up back up to $10k-ish by mid 2019 to early 2020, again lower than the former ATH, but far higher than the prior highs. Phase 2 ends around the middle of 2020, ignoring the temporary COVID collapse. P2 support was around $5k, resistance at $20,000, fair value $10k.

Queue phase three, starting late 2020/early 2021 (aka, now), where we’re once again in a boom. I don’t think anyone will be able to tell you where exactly this phase’s ATH will fall — we could already be in the more gradual pullback phase right now, or perhaps the bull market will resume throughout 2021. Let’s look at the more bullish case.

In an optimistic scenario, BTC continues to climb throughout 2021/2022 until it hits resistance around $150-250k. Then it’ll begin its gradual downturn through 2022 and into 2023 until it hits support, which I’ll say will then be $50k. It then steadily rises back to $100k in 2023/2024, which becomes its “fair value.” End of phase three, begin of phase four’s bull market with the BTC halving in mid/later 2024. 

Not gonna go into those numbers much, but I could foresee it hitting resistance around the $1-2m mark as early as 2025 or 2026, dropping back to $250k in 2026, then climbing up to $500k throughout 2027/2028. BTC halves again in 2028, rinse and repeat. 

---

Outside of specific numbers, my basic thesis is that BTC cycles last four years, corresponding with BTC’s halving dates. Subsequent resistance (ATHs) and support points are about 5-10x higher than that of the previous phase, with the gap between the lows and highs of a phase being somewhere in the realm of 5x. The “fair value” of each stage is around half of its corresponding ATH.

There’s absolutely no telling if such a pattern will hold up — and to what extent it’ll hold up — with a total sample size of only two *somewhat* distinct phases so far (not sure if I’d include pre-2012 price action). It’s not out of the realm of possibility to see BTC halving as a major catalyst for future growth though, assuming BTC truly does become a successor to gold as a store of value. There are certainly better cryptos that actually function as currencies out there, but it’s safe to say that BTC has functioned as such (a store of value) for quite a while now. 

Who knows, perhaps fiat money will collapse completely and BTC (and other cryptos) will see a huge surge in demand? Or maybe the Fed regulates crypto into the ground and we’re all left as bag holders? If something like that is going to happen, hopefully it’ll be the former for our sake. In any case, I’m sure my estimates will be completely off unless we somehow manage to avoid these kinds of black swan events. 

---

**TL;DR**: Unless the dollar collapses or crypto is regulated into oblivion, I think BTC will realize  1,000% growth every four years, corresponding with each halving date. It will hardly be a smooth ride up though, so avoid investing too much when BTC’s current value is more than 5-10x of the previous ATH.",t3_lykzdv,2021-03-06 13:43:12,2021-03-06

Sure, so inflation is simply the process of prices increasing. Printing money is generally seen as inflationary because it adds money into the economy, decreasing the value of the currency and increasing the value of everything else. Blah blah you know this part already. 

However, one thing you cannot forget. Our economy isn’t just made up on money. It’s made up on cash and *credit*. 

Credit, as you know, is debt.
Loans, credit cards, mortgages etc etc. 
when people don’t have enough money to buy something. They use credit to fill in the cash that doesn’t exist. 

So, in the scenario that a government and central bank needs to start printing money (usually during back economic times like recessions) the reason is because people aren’t spending money. People aren’t spending money during bad times because of debt. You see, when people take out loans they must pay back interest every month. You know this part. But as debt increases so does their debt burden (interest). The more one pays in debt burden, the less they have to spend. The less one has to spend, the less another makes. The less another makes AND the more THEY must spend on debt burden means even less they spend and even less the next guy makes. This is what causes cycles of recessions. But what if people take out so much debt, that their debt burden is so high that they don’t make enough income to pay for the interest? 


Default. They default. And when that happens they lose their money. They can’t spend, so the next guy gets no income, he can’t spend, so the guy after that gets no income. This goes on with institutions, companies,
Individuals, everyone.
Until we have a recessions. 

Now, it’s okay! There’s way to fix the issue. Let’s looks at two that are important to the topic though. 

The government and FED can either print money or lower interest rates. By lowering interest rates, the price to borrow money is super cheap. Meaning people are more willing to take out loans and then will have money to spend to boom the economy again. 

But what if interest rates are already at zero? Cough cough, like right now?

Well, the last thing they can do is print money. BUT, because people
We’re spending not just money, but credit. And now credit is leaving. As long as the fed prints money at the same speed at which credit is disappearing, then no one will in theory lose any income and won’t gain anything. Which means they won’t over spend, and thus wouldn’t cause inflation. Again, inflation is simply the idea of prices going up because of high spending. So even if they print money, as long as spending doesn’t go up, inflation won’t go up. 


This is why I didn’t explain it in the first comment since it was kinda long... so:



TLDR; as long as the fed prints money at the same pace people are losing credit. Then inflation will not increase or be created.",t3_lykzdv,2021-03-06 22:14:13,2021-03-06

Your employer would need to setup an account with an exchange, make a deposit of your commission amount to the exchange, then withdraw the BTC to your wallet. The only “questionable” part comes from how you guys choose to do spot prices. If I were running the company, I’d have you sign a waiver that says that you understand bitcoin is volatile and subject to rapid price changes, and that at noon (or some other specific time) on the days you get paid, $X will be transferred to the exchange, and what you get out will be a combination of the spot price and associated fees, and that the amount of BTC received won’t necessarily perfectly reflect the amount of your commission check. That way you couldn’t try to sue to company because your commission check was $1000, but you only got $998 worth of bitcoin because of fees and changing spot price.

So you wouldn't literally need everybody to spend all of the money in the world on Bitcoin, you'd need that to be about $3T.

I don't believe that's gonna happen in one year, but what happens when broad money say doubles over the next 10 years (actually 6 years at the current rate of expansion)? It starts to come into the realms of possibility and not even at the absolute crack pipe end of the idea spectrum either.

NFTs, and blockchain technologies in general, will evolve and serve legitimate purposes for every industry in ways that Bitcoin is not designed to do so.

You are incorrect when you say that companies are not buying altcoins. There are institutional investors in Ethereum for instance - though far less than in Bitcoin, as should be expected currently.

It's weird that you are so ardently defending these youtubers. Do you want to be one of them? Are you one of them? Do you idolize them? That's how it's coming off. It reminds me of people going out of their way to defend billionaires.

The fact of the matter is the Youtube videos all copy each other's thumbnails to pull in views. Youtube is literally all about getting views. Most content is low-effort and the majority of crypto videos I watch is just some guy making random speculations... and they don't know anything more than anyone else.

The whole  idea of Bitcoin is so that you can make money and spend money without big banks getting control of it. Big banks and government will always try to control your lives and rob you blind if they could and have in the old  days by taking your gold and freezing your bank accounts during a war or a crises.  Basically if they control your money they control you. In my grandparents days, they were farmers. They would go to the market with they’re fruits and vegetables to make money.  They would take there cash and save it under their mattresses, because they never trusted a socialist govt.  In Malaysian in the street market that is how buisness is done., but this time they are using crypto currency. They too don’t trust there govt. With this whole new financial reset that is suppose to be coming soon, guess who gets screwed? It will be us the people not the governments. So fight back and end the existing big banking systems because they always get bailed out, but we the people never do. 
Crypto means freedom. In Libya when war broke out a lot of rich people decided to leave their homes and flee.  They did leave but without their money, banks closed and when they opened, you were not aloud to take your life savings with you Sad really. Fight back and take control of your freedom.

If they are right, then btc profits will buy them time to restructure their offerings to keep them competitive. They say they want to start building software tools on the blockchain.  They will be able to report gains on the year even though their sales revenue and profit decrease. 

If they are wrong, then their company will most likely go bankrupt given that they had to offer bonds totalling in the billions to pay for this bitcoin.

2609,gpuzw27,t1_gpsjah8,"I am both a gpu miner and asic miner. I may clear some of your doubts:

Bitcoin is no longer possible to be mined by a normal pc. This is because way before the CPU/GPU solves a block, the professional miners (using SHA256 ASIC) would find the matching hash, literally forcing you (and all other competing miners) to move on to another block. Then the hashing competition starts again.

The way to earn Bitcoin using a normal pc is to mine other cryptocurrencies with it, then sell those for Bitcoin. You can check out the software called Nicehash as a beginner. After making a Nicehash account, you get your Bitcoin address. Then test mining using your CPU for 5 minutes to get the feeling.

During that 5 minutes, you will feel that your case fan spins at high RPM, and CPU temperature is fucking hot. Because your CPU is mining a cryptocurrency and Nicehash will periodically pay you Bitcoin.

**Important: The main objective of mining is to get Bitcoin cheaper than what you can buy at the market. If your electricity rate is high, you will end up paying way more fiat (electricity cost, hardware cost) for the same amount of Bitcoin. If you think Bitcoin will worth more in the future, it's cheaper to buy Bitcoin directly instead, unless you have done the calculations that mining for Bitcoin is cheaper.**",t3_lyblb4,2021-03-06 11:43:52,2021-03-06

Banks are very much aware of inflation, and inflation means you will need to borrow more and take on more debt as prices get inflated and you will not get a easier time to pay off your loan as you have to compare how little you would need to borrow in a deflationary economy or understand that the inflation was accounted for on the interest rate.",t3_lynr6o,2021-03-06 19:13:41,2021-03-06

3016,gpwz7iu,t3_lyx32z,"Lightning Network is a bunch of computers running special lightning network software all talking to each other over the Internet. The idea is that two computers can create a channel by sending some BTC into a special address from which funds can only be spent *by joint agreement of both parties*. These computers keep a ledger between themselves of who owns how much of the pledged BTC.

Then they can do transactions between each other by updating their notes on who owns how much *and both signing a valid Bitcoin transaction but not broadcasting it*. Either party can broadcast that transaction at any time, closing the channel, and so they *could* recover the BTC they own in the channel and send it on-chain just like any other BTC. But the magic happens when they *don't* broadcast the closing transaction. Until they do, they can do an unlimited number of payments between themselves.

The final piece of the puzzle is that many computers in the network have channels to multiple other peers. By composing these channels together, it is possible to chain payments through a series of channels. Thus, `A` can pay `D` even without a direct payment channel between `A` and `D`, if they can route a payment from `A -> B -> C -> D`, i.e. over channels between `A` and `B`, `B` and `C`, and `C` and `D`.  No on-chain transaction needs to happen for this payment; these pairs of nodes simply update their ledgers and sign (but don't broadcast) new channel closing transactions.",t3_lyx32z,2021-03-06 18:23:33,2021-03-06

You already have some funds in your LN wallet (having added them earlier), so you scan their wallet address to send the agreed amount to them - which is sent over the LN network - and they give you the tickets in return.
