1997,gqmfi8v,t1_gqm395k,"I think the whole sustainability thing is more nuanced.

From the end of WWII we have made huge steps on global wellbeing. Life expectation, infant mortality, violence, discrimination, they all are incredibly better than before, and constantly getting better. We have done much to enable third world countries to create their own wealth.

There is only one indicator that is getting worse and worse since the 70s in the western world, that is, wealth equality. And here we come with the sustainability narrative. In our world we are pushing people to consume less and less energy, to have a smaller footprint, and in the end: to accept to live with (relatively) less. Lower wages for manual labour, smaller houses. There IS more wealth, but it is going more and more in the pockets of the wealthiest.

One big effect is that people makes less children, so we have to ""import"" labour from other countries, people which have a poorer background and is available to work for less. Etc., etc., etc. It's a vicious circle. An important chunk of the sustainability concept is to educate people to live in a less equal society. Then we make people feel more virtuous and inclusive with ""alliances"" and wars to discrimination, and very few people notice that there is few to no inclusivity toward the real outsiders - ill people, mentally ill people, old people. That is, less productive people. In the end the big concept is: produce more and consume less, so few people will enjoy the bulk of extra wealth.

It's extremely telling that, in a subreddit about libertarianism, the libertarian opportunity of cryptocurrency did get overshadowed by this sustainability fetish: who cares about equality? We have to reduce our footprint. A lesson well learned which, in the mentioned thread, makes sustainability sound as an anti-libertarian meme. We can't employ energy to make our lives better? So, what the fuck is supposed to do, this energy? Should it be used to make us slaves? No, thank you.",t3_m2zez2,2021-03-12 06:00:11,2021-03-12

Bitcoin uniquely is able to capture logistically trapped, burned off, or curtailed power. This means Bitcoin is creating a revolution inppower supply management. Previously huge amounts of power, much of it renewables like hydro that cannot be turned off and either preceeds development or remains from past now unused developmentis pumped into the ground. Natural gas byproducts from other mineral and fuel extraction activities has traditionally been burned directly into the atmosphere. Now instead of wasting power we're mining Bitcoin. Instead of burning off waste we're converting it to power and mining Bitcoin.

After my most serious attempt st the age of 17, spending two weeks in a coma and several more weeks locked down after that, I decided I couldn‚Äôt even succeed at that and couldn‚Äôt keep putting friends and family through this. But I decided that if I had not gotten my life together, if I had not found any sort of joy or reason for being by the time I turned 30, I would finally kill myself for real. I would spend years thinking of my plan to make sure there was no failing. Just a few days before my 30th birthday, a girl I had been seeing told me she was pregnant. I decided right then and there to get sober. After years of endless attempts to get clean, I just decided and I‚Äôve been done since. I look back at all those years now. But even during those years too, if did not have those drugs, as destructive as they were, I would not be here to tell this tale. I don‚Äôt believe I would have made it through to a brighter side of the tunnel without that ability to numb myself for so long. I would have never made it this far. I had a home I own, I great job with great job security, a beautiful girlfriend, a new car. A cat who other than drugs also kept me alive. I would pray for my cat to die before my 30th birthday because then I could justify backing out sooner but he‚Äôs still here with me and my son. And I‚Äôm grateful to finally be alive.

This is a complete nonsense of a comparison. If we did away with all other currencies 95% of that infrastructure would remain and be required. THe comparison is how much energy is required for transactions and basic storage, claiming of currency. If you remove everything and move to bitcoin, how do we buy goods when transactions can take so long to be confirmed?  What Visa is effectively is saying is we guarantee you'll be paid, you use your card and your transaction is instantly confirmed. If you don't pay your card comes after you, the company you ordered something from doesn't lose out. If they did then every transaction would have to be confirmed fully before they'd release whatever you were buying to you.

Visa would still exist, so would banks. The banks would have your bitcoin instead and VISA would guarantee they'd pay the company on your behalf using bitcoin thus bypassing the need to wait for direct confirmation of a payment. 

The banking system at large is WAY more and provides way more than bitcoin does and is a woeful comparison. bitcoin provides more than visa does and isn't a good direct comparison but it's far closer than a comparison to the whole banking system. 

Bitcoin is absolutely horrible efficiency/electricity wise and not good for the environment but could be good and even necessary politically.

2086,gqn3f1i,t1_gqmmxe1,"For the sake accuracy: Reddit was founded in June 2005, and merged with Swartz's company, Infogami, ~December of 2005, forming Not A Bug.  Reddit made use of some of Infogami's content-management technology early in the relationship, and Swartz contributed to converting the site codebase into python from lisp.  

Ohanian and Huffmann effectively 'gave' him title of cofounder as the merger with Infogami led to him owning an equal stake of Not A Bug / Reddit.  He stayed for about two years, only tuning out after the Conde Nast acquisition in late 2006, when he criticized the new work environment and company productivity, before being asked to leave in Jan 2007.  Official sources credit him with the majority of the codebase transition, and I've never seen official confirmation that he ""never showed up"" or ""moped all day"" - though it has been confirmed that he checked out after the Conde Nast purchase & their asking him to leave was reasonable.  

He was ""a founder"" in title, but was not technically someone who founded Reddit - the site predated his joining the company.  Both takes are technically accurate, even if Ohanian might regret bestowing that specific title later on.  However, his role in Reddit is kinda contentious, because he used to get a ton of credit for the site, but was strongly downplayed or outright omitted in the years following his dismissal in 2007.

For folks wondering if or why it matters, his passing has led to him being somewhat martyred among free-speech advocates, and there is some meaningful motivation in tying his activism to what they see as oppression and attacks on free speech.  Things like banning of racist communities, TD, or FatPeopleHate are things they claim Swartz would have opposed - and being dead, he can't exactly refute those claims.  Those groups have clung to him, especially, given that Ohanian and Huffman have both explicitly stated that reddit ""wasn't intended"" to be a no-holds-barred free speech hub.",t3_m2zez2,2021-03-12 09:22:33,2021-03-12

Perhaps you should compare mining gold to mining bitcoin and transferring gold to transferring bitcoin. Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold and it's much easier to transport, send, protect, and hide. Bitcoin is also more scarce than gold. Bitcoin is easier and cheaper to store, send, receive, protect, and hide. Gold mining and transporting gold are both far worse for the environment than mining bitcoin and transporting bitcoin. Gold mining emits far more co2 emissions than bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and bitcoin can also be used for payments and as currency and the lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for extremely low fees. [Click here](https://8marketcap.com) to see a list of the top 100 assets by market cap. Gold is #1 with a market cap of $10.9 trillion and bitcoin is #8 with a market cap of $1 trillion right now. Almost all of that value sitting in gold being inefficiently stored and guarded in vaults can more easily and efficiently be stored on the bitcoin blockchain and more people will continue to realize this as bitcoin is continues to remain at the second stage of the evolution of money. 

Money always evolves in the following four stages:

1) Collectible: In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads, and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.

2) Store of value: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.

3) Medium of exchange: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins (worth approximately $94 million at the time of this article's writing) for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.

4) Unit of account: When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account. 

Gold is shiny and makes pretty jewelry and also makes great corrosion resistant semiconductors. It's difficult and expensive to transport and it requires equipment to reliably test it's authenticity. It's also difficult and expensive to adequately guard and protect. All of the value of gold could sit on the blockchain instead of sitting in a vault being guarded and then it wouldn't need to be transported in a jet in order to transfer it to someone.",t3_m2zez2,2021-03-12 05:32:29,2021-03-12

There needs to be mechanisms to be able to centrally store your money and have guarantees about it's safety, that's what banks are. Banks deal primarily in dollars but you can already keep other currencies in most banks and you can keep shares and bonds in them too. Bitcoin is just another currency, right now they don't want to take it on because they are supporting the dollar. 

Again in the hypothetical that the world moved away from the dollar banks would not only absolutely take bitcoins, they would be required to for society to function anywhere near how it does now.

Talk about blind faith..

The wild volatility makes Bitcoin as a viable currency less and less likely in the long run. Without stability there is only one way this will end.

Don't be a blind ideologue.

Do what is best for you (and do what all successful investors do) and have an exit plan.

I'm personally seeing some alarming signs. Among other things, a heap of retail investors who dont have the faintest idea about investing or blockchain or bitcoin are plunging in because 'everyone is doing it'.

Second, I doubt any of them are plotting to $5 wrench you in the head over your BTC; most of them either admire your vision and balls of steel for HODLing those years, are questioning themselves for not listening to you in the past, or are just jealous.

Third, if it really worries you, you can lie and say you diversified your portfolio into other ventures to lower your exposure. Say you sold some BTC for ETFs or an index fund or whatever.

Fourth, if they directly ask how much BTC you have, simply reply with ""Well, how much do *you* have in your bank accounts?"". Maybe they'll see how uncomfortable these types of questions are and respect your privacy.

Fifth, but most important, don't spend any money going out on dates with those office women. It's ok to go fishing with the bros, and maybe you can even educate them on BTC and get them interested, but those women are just out to drain your bank account and are probably not interested in learning more about Bitcoin.

EDIT: I will assume the fishing trip bros are not plotting to Jason Voorhees you into the bottom of the lake and just want to have you share some knowledge with them about Bitcoin. Likewise, maybe not all the women in the office are out to shag you out of your own wealth. Basically, if someone comes up to you and says ""Hey, you were right about Bitcoin, can you point me in the right direction for me to start my own journey?"" I'd say sit down with them and help them.

99% of altcoins/ICOs are scams and its difficult to evaluate them unless you know the history of these projects and are a programmer yourself so can evaluate their claims

Altcoins will come and go as we have always seen but bitcoin having a first mover advantage means that it is has the most network effect and best chance of surviving longterm 

One of the primary reasons Bitcoin was created was to have a sound monetary policy and digital scarcity , and being a multicoiner undermines all of this

Using wallets and software that supports multiple coins is confusing  and can lead to mistakes where you can lose money and makes the software far more insecure with a wider attack surface and potential for bugs and exploits 

When looking at the long term graphs , most altcoins pump and dump and lose value relative to Bitcoin. 

Getting involved with altcoins forces you to spend a ton of extra time learning complex and obscure projects 

Scammers prefer to target people that use altcoins as we saw with the ICO craze because Bitcoiners tend to have more experience and be more skeptical to evaluate their claims

Being involved in altcoins usually means you don't have long term time preferences and simply want to speculate short term which many people will consider a character flaw because you are more of a gambler 

Bitcoin has an uphill battle as is so any distractions weakens the possibility of it becoming a global p2p currency (Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency that can achieve this with its network effect and roadmap)",t3_m3f5va,2021-03-12 21:09:30,2021-03-12

Its blockchain grows astronomically faster and larger than Bitcoin's, to the point where AWS has started offering hosting services for nodes (how's that for ironic?). And then there's the EIP-1559 war between the miners and the core devs, and the core devs have all the advantages on their side.

Ethereum is so amazing that they [still can't come up with a narrative and product market fit after all these years.](https://danheld.substack.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum) The ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit. The ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce Bitcoin and other believers but there is no persistence of a singular narrative, ethereum still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.

3133,gqopgm6,t1_gqohxhr,"Ethereum is a premined scam.


1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4

https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23

2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security

3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness""

4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?

5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were than immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 

6)	For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

7)	Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon. This second attempt won‚Äôt do any better than the first IMHO.

8) the fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your eth unlike bitcoin being staked will expose you to taxes. Coinbase for example files 1099MISC for any staking over 600 usd a year to the IRS
