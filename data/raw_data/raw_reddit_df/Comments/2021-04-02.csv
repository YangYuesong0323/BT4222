I understand its not cool to loose money on BCH and i feel sirry for you, but in my opinion. Hate is never a good choice

&#x200B;

> its a top 15 Crypto buy Marketcap atm 

When I was scammed by Bitcoin.com in 2017, I lose a lot of money because I spent money buying BCH thinking it is Bitcoin with some special treatment from the website. (Roger Ver/Bitcoin.com market it that way).

I soon realise the scam and immediately sell BCH to buy Bitcoin, I lost money that way because BCH value drop so much.

And I am lucky that I did what I did despite suffering a loss. BCH in 2017 is rank 5th in market cap. Now it is almost 15th in market cap. BCH keep refreshing the all-time-low against Bitcoin. I don't understand why should I invest in BCH. To lose even more money to Roger Ver?",t3_mcd99v,2021-04-02 21:11:25,2021-04-02
163,gt56shr,t1_gt4ym6d,"I dont know about whats the real bitcoin, because in my opinion i dont care about this question so much.

In my opinion this question is marketing and divide more people than it brings them together

I mean i understand the BCH argument, that Satoshi wanted a cash system and thats why the BCH Community call it ""the real bitcoin"", when we talk about whats on the Whitepaper ideas right? But i also understand the BTC Community which has now a  cool store of value and thats a good thing tho

Btw i dont like the fact that Roger ver spread hate against BTC on twitter, but also it has a lot of an Entertainment factor reading the comments on thatüòÇ

But like i said i dont care who really claims the name, thats a decision everybody should choose by themself


But you asked another question, why BCH?

So there are a lot of BCH hater

Critism is completly oke, i respect that
But hate is just nonsense imo

Most people asked the question, why would anyone use BCH? I mean lets be clear, its not the greatest Innovation right? Its just like the cash alternative to the BTC which is the digital gold right now.

So the BTC/BCH Technology is bullshit right now, just outdated. Its much slower than cardano or the litecoin etc.

So in the last couple of years the BCH team has made a good job improofing their system.

Low fees (0,0025$), fast Transactions (10 minutes) fast means, fast for a first generation Technology. Its like the call of duty engine, same bullshit every year hahaüòÇ

So the reason i invested in BCH is because people are using it. In thailand its a big thing
You can pay everywhere with BCH, thais go crazy

Unbelieveble right? Its crazy how the most unpopular coin, gets back up to the charts this big. This also shows most people doesnt care about the best network Technology like Cardano etc. As long as it does what it should do, beeing a online cash system, people are happy with that

We are just all Crypto nerds saying we need the best Technology like every apple fan wants to have the next iphone but boomers doesnt car, the are comfortable with old phones

BCH has a really huge upside potential imo, just think about that the cash market is 10x times bigger than the gold market

And BCH has such a huge Traiding rate. At the moment the number is 72% of the whole marketcap in the last 24h 
( https://bitinfocharts.com/ )

So people are using this in fact, like real money

I think it has a huge upside potential right know

Because the Transactions are this huge i think it can explode, but who knows right? People had just wrong expectations about the charts in 2018

Just imagine this has another name and is a new altcoin from 2020

Everyone would be bullish imo

Just the name make problems and spread hatred in the Community because both sides are premature sometimes, but both sides could profit from the name bitcoin

We are all here for the same thing, against banks and their fiat money, lets get together lets all unite!
