I like alt coins because of the ability to make life changing money, but I definitely think Bitcoin is the safer option out of the choice between CHZ and BTC.

Anyways : Despite my advice against it a close friend of mine has a good amount of BTC on RH that he DCA'd in at like 10k.

Since RH is trash and there is no way to move these fake coins offline, wouldn't it be possible for him to sell and immediately rebuy on an exchange to avoid capital gains taxes?  On paper he would obviously make a good amount of profit but if he immediately rebought the exact same amount of BTC on an exchange, he would actually be down with fees etc.

This seems to me to be a logical way to avoid paying capital gains taxes but I am not sure about the legality of it.  He wouldn't be taking a profit if he turned around and purchased the exact amount of BTC..  so why pay taxes on something he's not taking a profit on?

Anyone know anything about this?",t3_mdh97x,2021-03-26 22:34:19,2021-03-26

My next questions would be do have children or do you plan on having children?

I would follow up with whether or not you own your home?  If yes, what is remaining amortization?  If not, when do you plan on purchasing one?  Depending on how some of those are answered, I might even ask about your careers...

60% is a heavy allocation into any asset and while I don't expect you to actually provide a response to any of the questions above, just promise you'll keep asking yourself those questions from time-to-time and remain comfortable with the answers to a 60% allocation risk tolerance level.

While you're riding a ""the sky is the limit"" attitude...just keep in the back of your head that while the sky is unlimited, the ground provides no give when you crash.

I should mention that half of that 60% is in stable coin (trueGBP, usdt) put in different platforms yielding 10%+ (understanding the risks of course). I sat with my wife and show her how long it takes to withdraw funds for her sake of mind. We plan on doing so while it last and the returns invest them in a tracker index. 

So 30% left where 20% is btc and 10% shitcoin (not that shit though). 

We have no loan nor credit other than mortgage and from the 40% of saving left, 20% is our 6 month emergency fund and 20% idle, for now.

1384,gsap1ba,t1_gsa36f9,"To complement /u/TheGreatMuffin's analogy:

- Miners are like the people who add transactions to a bank's ledger; the bank clerks who process transactions and add them to the bank's books. They get rewarded for their services in the form of newly minted money. Mining strengthens the network by increasing the amount of computational effort that legitimate nodes are collectively putting into the proof-of-work challenge, which makes it harder for adversaries to change the history of the blockchain by creating a forked chain whose height near-matches or outweighs that of the legitimate chain. Specifically, the network having more *mining power* mitigates 51% attacks (attacks by outside adversaries), and the network having more *mining entities* (and thus greater decentralisation of mining power) mitigates Sybil attacks (attacks by legitimate peers who defect, thereby becoming adversaries).

- Validators (which is what full nodes are, but miners also perform validation) are like accountants who check the books occasionally (i.e. every time a new block is broadcast) to make sure that all the transactions are valid and there is no tomfoolery going on. That is, they make sure that all transactions are signed by the sender, that they didn't send more than they have, and that all transactions balance. Validators aren't rewarded for anything; they validate for their own benefit, removing the need to trust any other node for information about transactions. As a side effect, they also strengthen the network by making it larger, and thus harder for adversaries to fool SPV clients. However, they do not make it harder for adversaries to create forks in the blockchain; only mining can do that.",t3_mdm46g,2021-03-26 22:46:36,2021-03-26

1407,gsa1xyj,t1_gsa1ich,"*TL;DR: better privacy and no need to trust third parties when receiving your bitcoin.*  


In order to know which transactions have happened on the network, a wallet needs to have a source for this knowledge. A full node is such a source. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions.  

A full node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

> One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
>  
>    
> If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
>  
> * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
> 
> * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
> 
> * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
> 
> * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
> 
> ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
>  
> If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
> 
> SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
>  
> Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
>  
> So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
>  
> Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
>  
> Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

1546,gs9kn06,t1_gs9db6g,"In short track, if you overlap the next competitor by two laps the race is over by default. Depending on the competition, everyone else in the heat is placed in their according standings as they are when the 2nd overlap takes place. In some competitions the remainder of the competitors in the heat are disqualified.

There's a video of a professional skater named Kim Dong Sung who does the 1.5 overlap which is called the Fury Race because he was cheated out of a gold medal by the Americans in Salt Lake City. This was so blatantly wrong and obvious cheating that it makes Russian cheating look like a work of art. Nevertheless it's in the past, people move on, but he had every right to be angry, and his only fault was that he was born in a weak country that can't stand up to the US. 

Back to the point, in the fury race the commentators clearly state that if he were to overlap them one more time the race would be considered complete. He deliberately keeps it to 1.5 laps so the other skaters don't get disqualified and so that they skate the whole race but also he didn't want Canada losing a medal because of his anger (his interview afterwards he just says he was angry Ono didn't show up after the crap he pulled and didn't give a crap about beating the other players). ABC, NBC, CBC and all North American broadcasts were shocked but they knew that Salt Lake City fiasco was absolute horseshit and they knew this athlete was the best but also pissed off.

Anything in the market with time-to-market longer than a few days will ditch this monster of a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù. It‚Äôs a great trading commodity alright, or an asset to invest in, but currency it is not.

Fiat money exists for a reason. Some (or should I say most?) was paid for in blood. The reason all currencies accepted in supermarkets around the world are fiat is because the REAL power behind those currencies are somewhat reliable. A coup or a war isn‚Äôt going to happen overnight to hurt that reliability, so fluctuations are retarded and absorbed by a great many things before the average folks feel it - in a bite size at a time. Governments are not infallible, but they collapse much less often and not abruptly.

By skipping the power-that-be and ‚Äúfree‚Äù the money from government control, that money renounces all support from said government in terms of stability. Hell, big-time traders might be backed by government to pump or short the ‚Äújailbroken‚Äù currencies to add insult to injury.

With the value of BitCoin where it is today, there‚Äôs no r/WallStreetBets possible to organize a global union to resist the troublemakers. The coin‚Äôs value will stay wild.

In a personal perspective I prefer innovation and freedom. But on a global economic perspective I prefer stability. While the two are indeed conflicting, I just want to remind you that governments are still more reasonable and open for negotiation than oligarchs or crony capitalists. They claim that higher bidders win, but in reality it‚Äôs only when the bidder is their friend.

It‚Äôs not the fault of BitCoin to fall in the grasp of the pigs, but unlike backed currencies there‚Äôs nothing you can do once the grasp over large portions of coins is secured.",t3_md1fk8,2021-03-26 18:22:26,2021-03-26

Other people cited (DB Cooper, Jack the Ripper) knew they were committing crimes, and it would have been obvious to them from the start that they‚Äôd have to keep their identity secret.

But there must have been a time when Satoshi was just a mulling over ideas, with no clue if it would even work, never mind how big it would become. Plus of course, he wasn‚Äôt doing anything illegal, so privacy is just a personal preference rather than an operational necessity. Academics are usually extremely keen to share ideas in the community. I imagine being cut off from your colleagues like that would have been a significant impedance to his work.


I find it remarkable that he was 100% anonymous then. No shared usernames, no discussions with colleagues, nothing. A clean break when he started bitcoin.. Even the Silk Road guy contaminated his identity in the early days of his projects, and he had a bloody good reason to be careful.

2330,gs8fq39,t3_md49ju,"Thank you.

I need to write something to solidify this a bit so here's my interpretation of what just blew my mind -- again.

Bitcoin is a protocol. Forget technology for a second, it is a manifesto, a set of well defined rules that allows us as people to keep a record and an account of our economic contributions in the form of units in a way that is fair.

It is the basis of every other cryptocurrency, and now that it is established, other protocols are just that: other protocols. They will always be a different take on this protocol, but while others experiment with all that, Bitcoin is gaining adoption and technologies that rely on Bitcoin's protocol.

Like UDP, other protocols will exist for unique applications, but Bitcoin will be the foundation beneath the most stable and commonly used applications relating to monetary store and exchange. (I don't mean DeFi necessarily, I mean trading for goods and services).

One thing that alt-coins don't have, is Bitcoin's existing ledger and account which means we can't just up and change protocol without starting over, so for the role of recording global economic activity, Bitcoin and the ledger we have today is it. Bitcoin 2.0 (like HTTP/2), will simply be built on top of Bitcoin's existing protocol and its existing ledger.",t3_md49ju,2021-03-26 07:48:19,2021-03-26

2332,gs7naqn,t3_md49ju,"Based on the manifesto you linked, if satoshi was a true cypherpunk it would follow that one of his primary motives be to retain privacy. Ironically, Bitcoin is far from private, and it seems that the governing bodies are focused on creating processes that more easily track users via the open blockchain. Regulation a la KYC through exchanges has exposed a large part of the user base of Bitcoin and many dont realize this. There is no question that governing bodies haven‚Äôt already begun developing an even more advanced platform that easily maps wallet addresses with customer identities and follows the flow of Bitcoin transactions between users. Such a development would render the privacy among Bitcoin users to be far inferior to basic cash. Think about how criminals have been caught through tracking the blockchain‚Äî and this was early days. I own a lot of btc, more than most people, but I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a solution to the issue of privacy as outlined in that manifesto, unless some sort of off-chain solution is created to obfuscate transactions.

u/LNtipbot is a bitcoin tipping bot operated by a user of the community. It allows users to send/receive satoshi tips on r/bitcoin and r/lightningnetwork, and of course it allows you to deposit and withdraw satoshis using lightning network. 

The lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for almost no fees. 

[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) exchange, [okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/) exchange, and [strike app](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that you can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it, and [kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) exchange will also be integrating it this year.  

You can use the lightning network to send instant bitcoin payments to other lightning users, you can [buy anything online where Visa debit cards are accepted](https://paywithmoon.com/) using the lightning network, or you can [buy gift cards](https://www.bitrefill.com/) for practicality any big store from [more than one reputable business.](https://foldapp.com/) 

Using the lightning network has a similar feeling to discovering bitcoin all over again, and I suggest every American reading this to try out the [Strike App](https://beta.strike.me/faq). Strike app has no fees, and you can deposit cash and buy bitcoin and it'll be instantly sent anywhere using the lightning network, or you can send a lightning payment and receive cash in your bank. This means that you can also use Strike App to fund lightning integrated exchanges with bitcoin instantly, to fund your lightning channels with satoshis, or to make instant lightning payments, and all without any fees.",t3_md49ju,2021-03-26 11:24:20,2021-03-26

All old bitcoiners know the cryptocurrency that Satoshi and any cypherpunk would most support today. It's the one that the cypherpunk manifesto describes perfectly. Satoshi even described an idea that was basically ring signatures back in the day, and he told us it may be a possibility to add to bitcoin in the future.

I don't currently see that other cryptocurrency as a good investment right now though. It's the one cryptocurrency that first world governments truly hate and fear and the US government already has a million dollar bounty out to breaks it's anonymity. It's has negative connotation and I don't think many companies and institutions adding will be buying it and I doubt there will be an ETF being created for it. I just don't think it will have the value and infrastructure that bitcoin has, and I even fear that some first world countries could even attempt to ban it, even though banning decentralized math is unenforceable. Therefore I don't see it as a good investment right now and I don't own any of it.

The amount is also unknown and raising it too much will cause centralization.

tl;dr - Bitcoin is just a software protocol much like TCP/IP and bittorrent are just software protocols. Satoshi was a cypherpunk and his real identity is probably Len, the same cypherpunk who helped create TCP/IP. Len also worked on PGP with the cypherpunk Phil, and was roommates with a cypherpunk named Bram who invented the bittorrent protocol just 4 years before Satoshi first uploaded the bitcoin whiperpaper as the ecash whitepaper, which was less 6 months before Satoshi released bitcoin to the world and the genesis block was mined. Len also worked with another cypherpunk named Hal, who I'm sure most of you already know of. Len and Hal lived close to each other. Hal was the first person to mine bitcoin after Satoshi and Satoshi sent the first bitcoin transaction to Hal. They both passed away. Rest in peace.

Bitmain also used their miners before selling them as new. The whole BCH thing was funded by Roger, Jihan, and Calvin. They attacked bitcoin and spammed the BTC blockchain and pumped BCH, dumped BTC, and tried to get enough miners to switch so that BCH have the longest chain and would be bitcoin.

I'm sorry I can't tell you.  but there is no doubt that it would have been a project that satoshi would have supported.

for the record, there is one other altcoin that satoshi did express public support for, confirmed.  it has merged mining with bitcoin and serves as a way to decentralize DNS (domain names).  I'm terrified to say its name, lest I face another ban, but it provides a way to register .bit domains without going through the centralized ICANN.  so there is a precedent that satoshi did respect and support other cypherpunk projects in the ecosystem.",t3_md49ju,2021-03-26 07:11:15,2021-03-26

It literally says on those links that one of the benefits is to avoid price slippage (paying more for some of the bitcoin due to your massive order eating up the cheaper supply). 

For the second part, idk. You need buyers first of all. I‚Äôm sure that happens though. If I‚Äôm Tesla and I buy $1.5 billion in bitcoin, I would want to negotiate a set price. Whales will sell that otc. That prevents the price from going up on that sale. Now, I‚Äôm sure those whales will start replacing those bitcoin in the open market, on any dips.

2648,gs9q6no,t1_gs9b91p,"Its because on a regular exchange, the price would go up while they buy. Keyword is ‚Äúwhile‚Äù. So putting a buy order for $1.5b in btc your first $100m would buy at 55k/coin. The next 100m maybe bought at 56k, etc. not to mention if people see a massive buy order at a certain price, theyll know demand is up and refuse to sell at that price. You will effectively get less btc for your $1.5b. Actually its much worse than my 55k and 56k example. The coinbase depth chart shows an $300m in buy order would eat all current sell orders up to $80k/coin.

The opposite happens when you try to sell, except it drives price down while you sell. You get less money for every btc. 

So its in both parties interest to first find a matching buyer/seller whale off the exchange at a set price. The deal happens. And the market reacts after, not during the deal.",t3_mdagez,2021-03-26 16:14:59,2021-03-26
