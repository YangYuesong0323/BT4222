I don't believe btc will fall or go below 10k within the next month. I buy a call option for 10k strike price, current price is 45k.  So it is considered In the money.

If it never falls but instead goes up I'll profit and the strike price will not be met.

Question

What's stopping anyone out there right now from doing buying these type of call options and getting btc at a rediculously low price? Cause realistically within the next month I don't think most people believe it will drop to 20k let alone 10k.

Or there is a range that most people will have to set their strike price for call options?

I.e. if btc is 45k currently. Your call option strike price is 45k to 30k only.

At first I didn't think it could get much beyond a dollar, then after it had crashed from $30 I was like 'wow, it can go THAT high?', then later watched with disbelief as it reached $1400 and crashed during MtGox. 

After that, I started becoming more convinced it could get a lot higher, and once an exchange opened that seemed trustworthy (because a lot of people lost money in MtGox), I started buying what little I could afford. I should have gone in a lot more aggressively, but I was also pretty poor for five years, even sold some of what I had to get through an extra rough bit.

2109,gmo6gx5,t1_gmnhiac,"I thought I was tough enough.

I thought it would be funny.

I thought I could handle it.

I was *wrong*.

There I was, a couple beers into a particularly jovial dinner party at my friend‚Äôs house.  We were playing cards and enjoying each other‚Äôs company, as well as a large bowl of homemade salsa fresh from the host‚Äôs garden.  He prides himself on his ability to grow many delicious peppers, and had a small bowl of them proudly on display in the middle of the kitchen, near the bowl of salsa.

Now, this group of friends are no strangers to spicy foods.  We frequently play our own versions of ‚Äúhot ones‚Äù style games with wings and *hot* hot sauces.  Over the past year I would say I‚Äôve conquered some pretty heinous hot sauces.  Last Dab, Da Bomb (beyond insanity), Mad Dog 357, etc.  each of these sauces are no joke, but after a few minutes of playing up the drama for laughs, we always are more or less unscathed.

Tonight, I was really the life of the party.  I was funny, intelligent, and had the body of a heavy lifter.  I was somebody to *everybody*.  But much like the foolish Icarus, I was soaring much to high on my own party fumes and shifted my attention to this bowl of peppers.  I asked my friend ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the hottest pepper in that bowl?‚Äù  He replied that the small, wrinkly, bright red devil in the center was a Carolina Reaper.  Now, I‚Äôd heard of these bastards before, and their reputation as being the hottest pepper on earth was dangerously piquing my curiosity.  With brazen confidence I plucked the pepper out of the bowl and proclaimed that I would eat it right there and then.

‚ÄúI can handle this‚Äù I thought.

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be *that much* worse than those hot sauces‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll probably just burn for a minute and then I‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

Dear readers, I was *not fine*.  Despite the pleas from my friends, I was determined to kick this party into overdrive and cement myself as the legend of our spice group who conquered the mighty Reaper.  I took one last look at the pepper and popped it in my mouth.  Seeds and all.

My immediate reaction was tame.  It just tasted like any normal sweet pepper.  Crunchy and fresh with a very mild taste.  Could this really be it?  Was it just a mild pepper?  Was it all just an exagger- before I could finish the thought, the seeds had emulsified, and things got dark.  *quickly*.

The pain was instant, and unrelenting.  Immediately, my stomach tried to reject the nuclear Holocaust I had just subjected it to and started giving me violent hiccups that turned to dry-heaves.  My face was bright red and tears were streaming down my face.  I immediately ran to the bathroom with a glass to drown the pain with water from the sink.

Friends, I took a long look at myself in that bathroom mirror and contemplated the horrifying possibility that this might be my life forever.  My own arrogance and hubris had led me to this very spot in reality and I had no one to blame but myself.  I wasn‚Äôt cool, I wasn‚Äôt funny, I wasn‚Äôt smart.  I had the body of a *heavy reader*.  What seemed like an eternity (likely 8 minutes) passed while I stood lurched over the bathroom sink drinking glass after glass of water.  The water of course did nothing to quell the sting of the pepper and with every wretch of my stomach still rejecting the hell-berry I imagined how much worse it would hurt coming back up.  I somehow forced myself to keep it down and after an *excruciating* 15 minutes the pain finally began to subside.

I will never, ever subject myself to that again.  I basically maced my tongue and throat at point blank range.  Luckily I didn‚Äôt have any long term side-effects,  but that was without a doubt the most painful thing I have ever eaten.

**TL;DR**-  OP better pray to fucking Zeus himself that Bitcoin never reaches $69,420 or they are in for a wild fucking ride.  These peppers DO NOT fuck around.",t3_lfniw7,2021-02-09 14:11:34,2021-02-09

Yes. (Keep your Bitcoin.)

No. (Proceed)

Locate investment to grow your wealth. Evaluate risk adjusted return. Sell Bitcoin to invest in asset with greater return. 


This is simple. What did the wealthiest do during gold‚Äôs hard money haydays? They invested in the means of production. Putting their money to work to rake in more gold. Gold didn‚Äôt become worthless because the number stopped going up on its own. They just found more ways to bring in more gold.

The total amount of all bitcoin mined is nowhere close to the total amount of bitcoin available, or liquid, so it is almost as relevant as any other random number. 

The relevance of the most recent purchase price comes together with the liquidity. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, which makes its purchase price very variable.
