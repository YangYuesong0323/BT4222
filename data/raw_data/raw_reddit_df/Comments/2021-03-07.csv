Bitmain discovered and patented a trick that gave them a mining advantage, hid it from the rest of the community, then attempted to force a hard-fork to maintain their unfair advantage.

When miners have too much power the three-legged stool becomes increasingly unbalanced. Miners are expected to act selfishly, but as long as they're all on an even playing field order is maintained.

So everyone know now that miners are liars. Many people lost real money on btc2x futures.

Yes, miners have one important job and get paid for it. That's all. They can easily block any upgrade without any reason just because they can or just to feel the power they don't have. So no more that shit again.

47,gq3docx,t1_gq1r3sb,"> what incentive could a miner possible have to show active hostility toward the network? 

Bitmain had developed a mining exploit called ""covert ASICboost"" that let them mine faster and cheaper.  They didn't reveal it publicly; that was the ""covert"" part of it.  Instead they held back mining rigs from customers, running their internal version of the mining firmware on them, and later shipping out worn-out used machines to customers, while winning the block mining race like crazy and stashing all that sweet, sweet BTC for themselves.

They were actively FUDding SegWit because it would prevent them from using their exploit in secret any longer.  Then, when someone discovered the exploit (by going over the firmware byte-by-byte) Bitmain split off BCash to try to preserve their advantage, and then they started dumping their BTC reserves to ruin the market for BTC and convince idiots that everyone was switching to BCash.

Does that make it any clearer?

404,gq2sv08,t1_gq2i4sx,"There a few interesting factors at play right now. 

One is the f2pool dumping that's going on, [which George is attributing to about 10% of their operation, in Inner Mongolia, being forced to shut down by the Chinese government because of their environmental impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSm7_J84y6A), which he and a few others believe is artificially suppressing the price by flooding the market with excessive supply as those miners liquidate and cash out. 

Despite that, we are seeing remarkable support at this level, with slight increases each day. 

My understanding is that the f2pool mining sites mentioned above have until the end of the month or sometime in early April to cease operations, so that's about how much longer they can try to do what they're doing. 

Factor two is the institutional buying, which is only heating up. It's likely going to take the companies that attended Michael Saylor's recent seminar, where he shared his playbook, a few months to get their affairs in order. Meanwhile he keeps buying, and we're seeing tons of formerly *publicly* skeptical banks start to say good things about BTC. 

Moreover we have the stimulus coming. 

Not to mention another Redditor's observation that GBTC is trading at a negative premium right now, which has, historically, predated significant bull runs. 

So I would say ""we're going to burst any day now,"" but none of us understand all the physics of the market, so it's speculation on my part.",t3_lzjp3e,2021-03-07 15:25:10,2021-03-07

A few years ago I was at Thanksgiving at my uncle and aunt's place, and my girlfriend and I got mega high, and at some point one of the older (read: 65+) crowd - maybe even my dad - starts asking about QR codes, or maybe I bring it up to my cousin, who's a weird artist, I really don't remember - I was very high, and am pretty high right now - but something about the very concept of QR codes, which are so yesterday, being a topic of conversation at a Thanksgiving not too long ago - was just too funny, and my girlfriend and I both lost it. 

Moral of the story, we're early adopters, and one day my dad will understand QR codes.",t3_lzjp3e,2021-03-07 15:17:32,2021-03-07

Yes with some pretty serious risks that everyone needs to understand. First not all of these providers have insurance. Second the providers that do have insurance do not ensure against business failure. Third you will need to send at least 150% to collateralize the loan making the second point a sticky issue.

It's one thing to risk your BTC it's another thing to risk 150% as collateral combined with that risk.

Oh and as a side note this is insurance on the price point when loaned. So if the business fails and declares bankruptcy and you have to go to court (mt goxxed) and then wait years for it to all settle your BTC was already long long gone and you will only ever get a fraction of the USD settlement.

They're intrigued by bitcoin, when I've talked to them about it, and I strongly suspect they would invest there, but they are hesitant since they don't feel comfortable that they understand it, and feel they could lose it all accidentally. 

So, they will likely buy gold. Not as aggressively appreciating as it was, and nowhere close to bitcoin's current run, but it's something they understand. They can see it visibly, it has held long term value, and has a chance of being useful for trade in the unlikely case of complete economic breakdown.

The class is from 2018 but lays down the basics step by step even for those of us who are interested lay persons without an in depth finance or computer science background. (I understand about 40% of it but I'm paying maybe 35% attention so that's 14% knowledge penetration and I'm learning a lot.) 

Gary Gensler is clearly clearly an expert and I'm glad he's back in the administration. Anyone in the SF bitcoin meetup that can invite him to come and speak, I'd like to hear an update on his ideas about bitcoin, and rules around SPACs, ICOs, and other somewhat dodgy investment vehicles.

2553,gpzxlpo,t3_lz4s6p,"I love this. Listened to the whole thing, moving onto the next lesson. And I'm glad he wants to bring more regulation to this space. Regulation will be a massive win for the crypto space. Why? Because it makes it significantly easier for institutional players to invest. I don't mean trade, as hedge funds are already doing so. I mean invest into, or hold onto their balance sheets alongside cash. Not to mention integrate into their business models. 

It sounds as if he truly believes blockchain could solve a lot of the problems in the financial sector. Yes, he taught at MIT, but let's not forget that he also came from an almost 2 decade career at Goldman Sachs and was their co-head of Finance, leading their global Treasury department. With his background and experience, he knows the exact pain points of the Finance world, and believes that blockchain can solve a lot of them. I believe his focus won't be on banning cryptos or anything like that (I mean, come on, he was the reason why Bitcoin futures exist today), but how to make it easier for companies to embed and integrate blockchain technology into their current ecosystems. 

Very much looking forward to the positive change he helps bring.",t3_lz4s6p,2021-03-07 03:00:01,2021-03-07

He is evil incarnate because he comes off as individually nice but is systemically and institutionally a monster. Vs Trump or Mcconnel where they are just straight evil to your face.

He said the goal of this is to make ""economic rents"" of people, where you do nothing and collect money off other hardworking people. This is another word for slavery Gensler. Decentralization stops all of us people living below the poverty line from becoming even more enslaved to bank debt.

&#x200B;

He constantly brings his brother, finance investor, and his other investor friends into class to namedrop. 

&#x200B;

When students start to ask about how central banks could be evil like GS, he shushes them and deflects that they shouldn't use those words.

&#x200B;

He constantly defers to the computer science phd and MS students, 3 of them, because he knows he doesn't know how it works. He claims ""read the white paper"".

[The Impact of Blockchain Technology on Finance: A Catalyst for Change](https://www.sipotra.it/old/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-Impact-of-Blockchain-Technology-on-Finance-A-Catalyst-for-Change.pdf)

It’s only about 100 pages long. 

The TLDR is he’s enthusiastic about BTC and thinks the world of finance will absolutely adopt crypto soon and in many ways.

He also has a short list of cryptos he thinks pass the Howey test and are “legal in the US” (BTC, ETH, LTC, Roger Ver’s shit coin) (page 43). And it doesn’t look like he views ICOs, tokens and highly centralized or premined “cryptos” very favorably mentioning both how other SEC officials (on page 40) view them as securities and how he’s surprised so many projects have gone this route despite clear evidence that the SEC has and will go after that sort of thing for unregulated securities trading and fraud (following the DAO fiasco, page 5). He also seemed a little dismayed the SEC mostly went after blatant fraud cases where people lied about partnerships with major institutions. He even warns people and institutions against investing in ICOs (page 33).

This suggests that when he’s the top regulator that more shit might actually get regulated. And I anticipate a great regulatory filter in the not too distant future that wipes out most of the “coins” currently on the market.",t3_lz4s6p,2021-03-07 06:06:49,2021-03-07

I'd say he adapted, once bitten twice shy. Seeing Bitcoin as an investment is detrminental to using it as a currency. Why would I spend it if it will go up in value in a week? People shit on inflation and monetary policy but deflation that Bitcoin has would ruin the economy. In a way inflation forces you to spend money, invest it in a business or give it to a bank for them to manage and invest.

My personality is inherently one to give up on things that I feel like I've ""missed"" and that was part of what led me not to invest for a long time. But as I age and get wiser (I hope), I've realized that it's still better late than never with this kind of thing, and that my logic (it's already boomed; it's too late) would have applied just as well almost at any time down the line on Bitcoin's bull run.

When it went to $10,000 I'm sure people were thinking/saying the same thing then: it's already boomed, too late to get in now, etc. But it doesn't stop, and like you said, most people are actually not invested. I got in around the same price as you and therefore I've already seen gains but I'm ready to hold for quite a while and potentially never sell it if it gets as big as I feel that it will. Very happy I got in, and it's not too late even now. I've been consistently buying more and more, especially during the recent dip.

I can't see how this is a bad thing.  So many people cry 'doesn't incentivize' but I call bullshit.  I think most people want meaningful work and a meaningful social life.  This stupid 'work is everything' culture is just penury.  Call me a utopian but what's wrong with 3 to 4 days work with higher pay rates?  The money gets recycled into essentials and leisure anyway.

Also i think the controlled “inflation” aspect of fiat promotes the use of the currency instead of “hoardage”, so you may be right in that hoarding will be a problem.

For now employers have to buy BTC and then give it to there employees. Or as /u/jstsqzd said sell product for BTC. But this is also tricky in terms of US taxation since BTC is a commodity.

Imagine Walmart taking BTC as payment. Now they have a shitload of BTC, hey lets get rid of it by giving our employees the option to get paid in BTC. Or walmart just sells it for fiat lol.",t3_lz8aux,2021-03-07 14:46:55,2021-03-07

On the other hand, fiat currency is still backed by a government and is more readily available as everyone has access to it and is the default currency for buying and selling. 

So the question to be answered would be how will Bitcoin eventually become the default currency considering it’s still highly inefficient in terms of transactions and the price is crazy volatile. Most people would feel safer with a fiat currency for now as it’s much more stable. It just doesn’t sit right with business owners knowing that if they’d sold something for 1 BTC, it might be worth 10% less the next day. Of course they could hold it and BTC would likely appreciate in value in the current market. However, if they’d need to spend it right away to settle debts then their purchasing power would be diminished straight away.",t3_lz8aux,2021-03-07 14:08:41,2021-03-07

The effect of stimulus is not to buy more “corn”, in its metaphorical sense, it’s equilibrium out of rapid unbalancing caused by a global pandemic.

Money out of thin air (it’s still money by the way, it’s not casino chips that all of a sudden have lower value, although they will gradually be devalued as a macro effect of this, yes) provides an “temporary, sort of level playing field” in the country with the alternative being foodbanks, or deflation of the currency.

Can you guess what effect either of these two would have in your ability to purchase corn internationally?

Don’t even get me started on how our fixed-supply cryptos ultimately translate to a value understood in the very currencies we are talking about.

The problem here is how the printed money is properly directed to those in need. And the causation for the printer going Brrr is a pandemic.

I personally have noticed over the decades a lot of concern trolling bs talking points similar to that one. I've been told for years the way to measure a good tax cut is it stimulates so much economic growth it pays for itself. Iirc debt to gdp was low 30% in 1981, today it’s over 100%. So the tax cuts in say 81, 2001, 2003, 2017 have all been failures. These tax cuts were so bad, David Stockman in the 80s resigned, and in 2004 Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill appalled at the vandalism and theft against the American People's Treasury resigned in the wake of Cheney's ""deficits don't matter"" comment.

 What we got in exchange for those tax cuts is a Japanification heavily indebted  nation and basically facilitates all this money printing. We still got taxed, we got taxed by a mountain of debt and money printers. 

I find a lot of this is just concern trolling, they all line up behind Grover Norquist who has made half of US Federal politicians sign a tax cut pledge, and his stated goal is making the American People's Government so weak you can drown it in the bathtub.
