It's below average for companies that pay for security bugs (ATT is known to pay low), but at the same time, this was probably a very low severity bug.

This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).

Vitalik and many others in the ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness."" 

The ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated in cryptocurrency, but there is no persistence of a singular narrative and ethereum is still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.

Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 

The inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbies are misled into believing that ETH is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH while still following the rules of the smart contract. So Vitalik rolled back the entire blockchain because ethereum is centralized and Vitalik can do whatever he wants. He named the real ethereum blockchain as ethereum classic and calls his rolled back chain ethereum. ETH miners also recently said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so King Vitalik called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. Vitalik can only control ethereum because it's centralized and Vitalik can do whatever he wants.

The fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations, unlike holding bitcoin. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.

Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon and I have no expectation that the new ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.

The fact is, **ethereum is a centralized scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes** (how many ERC20 pyramid scamcoins run on top of ethereum again?) **but it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive premine.**

Now I'm going to talk about the current ethereum hype which is NFTs. NFTs can be done on bitcoin and they were actually done on bitcoin first, back in 2012 before ethereum even existed lol but bitcoin is already doing something that's actually important. NFTs have some actual uses but what people doing with them right now isn't one of them. [It costs anywhere from $70-$500+ to mint an NFT on ethereum](https://www.supercryptonews.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-mint-an-nft/) depending on where you do it, so they're [hyping shitcoiners/artists/anyone up and luring them into minting crap in the hopes of getting rich](https://fstoppers.com/opinion/nfts-are-pyramid-scheme-and-people-are-already-losing-money-554869) and NFTs are doing a great job of that at the moment. People are blowing millions of dollars worth of ETH minting NFTs hoping to hit the NFT lottery and get rich.

What these stupid NFTs are is just a cryptographic hash on the ethereum blockchain that points to the location of an image on the internet. That's all they are doing. It's far too expensive to actually store the image on ethereum, so they're just buying a pointer to the location of it on the internet lol and that pointer is on the ethereum blockchain. The server storing the image has no obligation to continue storing it and you don't own the image. You just own the hash that points to it.",t3_mkzb16,2021-04-06 12:41:21,2021-04-06

Things like censorship resistance for example. Ethereum is ran by a corporation named ""The Ethereum Foundation"" that profits from their premine and are subject to regulation and law.. Also the fact there is no hardcap makes it strikingly similiar to fiat currencies that are manipulated and groomed. And this may come as a big surprise but blockchains are ledgers, not databases. Blockchains make terrible databases. Ethereum scales into modern day internet where node opporators must use servers and data centers to store information, just like the internet. Full nodes are already 4TB and that hurts decentralization bad. Ethereum 2.0 is a waste of time and causes more problems then it solves. Not to mention the thousands of scams that are ran ontop of the massive scam. Seriously could go on for days about why it is total shit.

Which, true, they will, if they can get all those bitcoiners to leave bitcoin. 

But that will never fucking happen. Lol. And it‚Äôs not because bitcoin has decent branding. It‚Äôs because bitcoin actually changed the world 12 years ago. Wake up man. Why would anyone leave bitcoin? For a flippening to happen, you need more people going into any other single project MORE than they go into bitcoin. It. Wont. Ever. Happen. Unless. Bitcoin. Dies. 

And if bitcoin actually does die, all those other alts are going to be obliterated. 

I know. I know. It‚Äôs a bull cycle. And 80% of our visitors here are new to the scene. But what you haven‚Äôt witnessed yet is what happens to alts in a bear cycle. They shrivel up like fat cells that have been depleted, but they never seem to ever just fucking die. 

Then, as soon as new people start flooding in again in a few years, they all pop up and act like they‚Äôve been working their ass off like SpaceX to take humans farther. But the reality is they just take you out back, beat the cash out of you, and leave you their useless storefront to hold onto when the bankruptcies start rolling in over the next year. 

I promise you that half of the top fifty won‚Äôt be there in 24 months. Do you have any idea how many alts have been in the top ten that are now ‚Äúdead‚Äù projects?

For a cryptocurrency project to work, you need people joining your network. Running nodes. Mining (or staking/baking/whatever other crazy workaround people have found). But you need people supporting it. Using it. 

How many of you have bought some coin somewhere but never even dug deeper? Ok. Maybe you glazed over the white paper. Welcome. You guys are speculators. And you are going to get your ass handed to you. 

Now if you have held a currency long enough to get more curious, and actually run a node? That makes you a user. Now you are ready to evaluate one project. You will never be able to evaluate them all, because once every four years projects emerge at the rate of about five new shitcoins per day. 

So let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve been around for five years. You own bitcoin and run a node, you own ethereum and you are staking it too, because why not. And the two of them have been treating you fantastically for years, and all the while you have watched thousands of people financially perish along the way by trying to catch up by buying endless shitcoins. Nano. Neo. Vechain. Iota. These were kings just a couple years ago, no!?

For some new alt to best bitcoin, or ETH, you have to win over the users from that project. Good luck man. I‚Äôll stick with Bitcoin.",t3_mkzb16,2021-04-06 22:12:52,2021-04-06

1534,gtjxi88,t3_mkwvpm,"**Why do I choose Bitoffer to make my investment and gain profits?**  
‰∏ÄÔºé The first American Options Exchange in the world. 

BitOffer, the first cryptocurrency exchange that owns American Options Exchange, spot trading and a whole road map of bitcoin derivatives in the world, has launched spot trading, Options trading, and Leveraged ETF. 

BitOffer first launched Bitcoin Leveraged ETF which supports investors to long or short but never charges for margins, which makes the situation of being liquidated not be able to happen. 

BitOffer does not charge management fees, unlike the ETP on Huobi Global or MXC. BitOffer believes that charging this kind of fee does harm to users‚Äô experience in a long run.

Obtained the Hong Kong No. 1 license, BitOffer embarked on the road of compliance. As the world's largest Bitcoin options exchange, its daily trading volume exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars and daily active users are 100,000+. In the future, a one-stop STO service will be provided to support on-chain clearing and cross-chain transactions. 

Users can participate in transactions from their own wallets to asset custody transactions. This is a new financing method that conforms to government policies and will also be a digital future. In the general trend of currency, STO is linked to tens of thousands of real assets, which is a potential market of trillions. Therefore, this step of compliance is of great significance to BitOffer.

‰∫åÔºé Owning the perfect team to be reliable.

Team Working Core: Make transactions safer, make wealth more free, and make investment easier. With the Goldman Sachs quantitative team, Bitoffer launches A Quantitative Fund, to guaranteed capital and interest, with risk-free annualization of up to 20%.

‰∏âÔºé Many kind of products esp the Leveraged ETF.

In addition, the mechanism of ‚ÄúPositions Automatic Adjustment‚Äù of BitOffer Leveraged ETF promises the profits will be at least 3x, and even more than 17x. When the market goes one side extremely, the expected profits of BitOffer Bitcoin ETF is much considerable than opening long on Bitcoin Futures. 

ÂõõÔºé The difference between BitOffer and other non-compliant exchanges:

1. Without Fiat Currency

Under the premise of holding an exchange license to operate, Bitoffer strictly complied¬†with the relevant regulations of various countries on the encryption industry, and truly achieve exchange compliance.

2. Without Air Coin

In order to ensure the safety of users‚Äô funds, BitOffer only lists mainstream currencies, mainstream currency-related digital asset derivatives and wealth management products.

3. Without Platform Currency

BitOffer has always strictly complied with the laws and regulations of various countries and does not issue platform tokens, so that it will not constitute a centralized place for illegal fund-raising.

4. For the sake of Investors‚Äô fund

BitOffer designed the separation of hot and cold wallets, and the user's funds enter the cold wallet after recharging, effectively preventing black-box operations and hacker attacks on the exchange.",t3_mkwvpm,2021-04-06 18:06:46,2021-04-06

1647,gtjz96d,t3_ml78h9,"> The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an anonymous network layer (implemented as a Mix Network) that allows for censorship resistant, peer to peer communication. Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world. Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely. The software that implements this layer is called an ""I2P router"", and a computer running I2P is called an ""I2P node"". I2P is free and open source, and is published under multiple licenses.[5]
> 
> The network itself is strictly message-based (like IP), but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (similar to TCP, although from version 0.6 there is a new UDP-based SSU transport). All communication is end-to-end encrypted (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message) through garlic routing,[9] and even the end points (""destinations"") are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys), so that neither sender nor recipient of a message need to reveal their IP address to the other side or to third-party observers.
> 
> Although many developers had been a part of the Invisible IRC Project (IIP)[10] and Freenet communities, there are significant differences between their designs and concepts. IIP was an anonymous centralized IRC server. Freenet is a censorship-resistant distributed data store. I2P is an anonymous peer-to-peer distributed communication layer designed to run any traditional internet service (e.g. Usenet, email, IRC, file sharing, Web hosting and HTTP, Telnet), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a web proxy network using Squid, or DNS).",t3_ml78h9,2021-04-06 18:33:09,2021-04-06
