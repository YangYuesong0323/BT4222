You can work out similar differing scenarios for people who invested the same as you did, but who have a lower/higher salary than you. Or a wild mix of these two factors.

I would not believe someone saying that the current financial system is more energy efficient when they prevent no data to show this. Keep in mind Bitcoin's energy usage will always be targeted by people because it is one of the only large systems that can easily calculate and display it.

Also, people can't assume something is wasteful if it provides value to you and others. The value that Bitcoin's energy usage creates is the strongest network security on the planet. Each Bitcoin transactions doesn't require a certain amount of energy, the energy is mainly used to secure the network. It's a common error when people state that Bitcoin's energy usage will scale directly as its transactions scale, this is not true.

PoW is the only way to ensure that not one single entity, including a big government, can overtake the blockchain. It's literally the core of Bitcoin's guaranteed security and the reason why everyone is growing to trust it. Trust is money. Security is trust. Hash rate is security. Therefore not wasteful in the least.

And here we're not even talking about the fact that mining has a huge incentive to find the cheapest available source of energy to stay competitive, which means the most competitive and long term only viable sources of energy for mining are renewable and otherwise electricity which would go to waste. If you know anything about energy, you know that too many times energy is simply burned and discarded at the source because the grid can't take any more input.

Btc were expensive to mine long before their price exploded to the current level.

I think the only reason a private party would tend to fear accepting $10k is because it would be hard to conceal it until you can get it to a safe place, be it a bank or a hole dug in your backyard (if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into). But also depositing/carrying that much money often raises flags at banks or at places like customs. But, why should it? It‚Äôs your money right? Hopefully you didn‚Äôt steal it but should you have to explain yourself every time you want to liquidate something? Should you have to keep the government informed on where your assets are? I can‚Äôt imagine they actually need to know. I get that it‚Äôs harder to tax, maybe we figure out a better way to tax then. 

But try waking around with $10K in Bitcoin. You might feel a bit paranoid I suppose but you‚Äôre in no more danger than you would be waking around any other time without it. 

Why should we limit the movements of honest people because a minority of others will do bad? They‚Äôre going to do bad either way.",t3_mg2jbq,2021-03-30 13:29:19,2021-03-30
