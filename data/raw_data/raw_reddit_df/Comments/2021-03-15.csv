Turns out there is some value (less than 1 BTC). I sent him a letter asking about the origins of the wallet, but he hasn't responded yet.

Is there any way for me to find out whether the BTC are acquired legally or is that a non-issue as long as I file it for taxes?

My biggest worry is that the BTC is somehow illegal or illegal accrued and I get bit in the ass for using it in the future to buy a house or something big.

Said person gave me the wallet and the passcodes voluntarily. I successfully transferred the BTC to my ledger while I research everything and am not planning on using it before I know its 100% safe. Of course I will neatly file my taxes for it.",t3_m5eb22,2021-03-15 21:06:33,2021-03-15

Wouldn't affect bitcoin, it would affect bitcoin's users by making their lives even less private, requiring more efforts to report trades, undergo more KYC and share even more personal data etc (same for businesses). Depends on the details though, of course.

Essentially you are asking if the price will be higher or lower at a certain date. The answer is: no one knows. The aggregated opinion of redditors doesn't have any meaning either. So you won't get any smarter from asking such questions.

92,gr0lnmm,t1_gr0bja2,"Answering your question quickly: they simply make it easier to exchange assets. But the way this facilitation is done makes a lot of difference.

It is important to mention: the largest exchanges are centralized, that is, they guarantee (via contract) that you are ""owner"" of the equivalent value of the crypto-assets you manage (usually in USD) - until the moment you decide to do the withdrawal of values.

This means that you are not, in fact, ""owner"" of the crypto-assets that you buy and sell in a centralized exchange. You will only own these crypto-assets when you send them to a non-custodial wallet.

Centralized exchanges dominate the trading market, as they are a very profitable business model, and it is also worth remembering that this is a business model that remains from the dollarized and centralized economy.

Centralized exchanges centralize the assets of large communities and use privileged information to make highly profitable positions that generate hegemony in the market. This is not the proposal of the Bitcoin network.

In order for you to own your BTC, you need to use decentralized exchanges (DEX), where trading in crypto-assets can only be done if users, in fact, own their private keys.

So, the beginning of everything is in the private keys.

To obtain your private key from your BTC, choose a non-custodial wallet verified by the network. To do so, visit: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)

If you are going to use a centralized exchange, research the history (diversifying sources) first, find out about the foundation team and check if the company publishes (frequently) transparency reports with reasonable certification.

One of the most interesting breaking points that BTC brings to the financial market is decentralization.",t3_m5eb22,2021-03-15 22:41:13,2021-03-15

Having that said, price probably isn't the best proxy for stability if you're looking at the big picture, since Bitcoin's price is to a certain extend correlated to the inflation of fiat currencies. If BTC/USD goes up 50% a year and you have 50% price inflation in the markets (real estate, stocks, whatever), then you've maintained stable purchasing power when holding BTC.

243,gr0lyuo,t1_gr0loln,"> But will it make sense to transfer my balance from a ledger to the same ledger through Coinjoin?

In general yes, but keep in mind that extra transfers as well as coinjoin rounds will invoke transaction fees. You also will need to be a bit more mindful **after** the mixing. F.ex if you transfer 1.2345 btc into a coinjoin wallet, mix them, and then transfer 1.2345 btc back to your Ledger wallet, it will kinda be obvious for any observer that both transactions probably belong to the same person.  

So it's not as easy as just one or two extra transfers, but it's not rocket science either, esp. when privacy is desired :)",t3_m5eb22,2021-03-15 22:43:48,2021-03-15

If you really wanted to **keep** your crypto secure and still do this it's not hard.

1. Make a couple of wallets that accept Moner (e.g. Exodus)
2. Exchange your coins to Moner in wallet 1
3. Send Moner to wallet 2
4. Exchange back for the crypto you like

Afterwards, just use a VPN to access your wallet, trade, etc.

The banking system operates on the theory that the vast majority of people are rational. A piece of history to illustrate.  In the Depression what was then a small rural bank in Eastern North Carolina (that I won't name because it is still in business and MUCH bigger today) had a run by the local customers . The locals,  farmers mostly went to the main office and took out their money. They took the cash to the post office,  who at the time had savings accounts.  Deposited the cash at the Post Office. Post Office people took the cash back to the bank in the back door and deposited it . Bank then had more than enough cash to continue to meet the demand.

If a business, for some strange reason, needs a large cash withdraw; they need to schedule that in advance. Sometimes up to a week in advance.

A serious run on the banks would wipe them out before the line got formed up. There does not exist enough physical cash on the planet to cover a 20% financial system run let alone anything serious.",t3_m5gss9,2021-03-15 22:12:34,2021-03-15

Could BTC skyrocket in value once again?  Maybe.  But things have changed.  The prices are higher.  The mining rewards are much smaller.  Everyone knows about  BTC.  

The only people who can legitimately gain from buying BTC are those with large amounts of money.  They can turn hundreds of thousands of dollars into millions.

started to rise riiite then that week and had risen since .. how is that when I left it there almost a year and made no money on it whatsoever,, Yeah Robinhood huh mfrssss.
 And I put it there simply as a placeholder thinking somehow maybe that Bitcoin hq would algorithmicly matched who I am THEN with my account NOW.

 But not doin anything that deserves attention that those in need aren’t gettin at all.

*and okay it doubled as of recent Sooooo I’m sure I would’ve cashed out most of what I had in 2019 previous to that and left only 15% into it ..
  So to sum it up I lost MY 50MillionUSD. 
 Then the whatevr I would’ve left in it.
 Til it doubled. 

Even if I would’ve cashed out most of it in 2017 before the last rise I can remeber it would’ve been at least 35-40Mill..

  The shortbus?! 

      kg never been on that ride.

 Tbt only thing I wanted to do was build my auntie a house . Ground up deal.
 For her & for my daughter to visit. Stay summers like...

  And have something. 

 As I damn well tf should.

    What bus. Freddys nitemare much......

 I didn’t even think about that stupid 190$ I put into it back then til early 2019 is the thing.
   I remeber I was like wow internet chucky cheese coin cool lemme put a lil up for safekeeping. One thing stood out to me bigtime & that was that it’s gonna be ‘peer2peer’ man I was IN yep.
  It was the following 3 months after I moved my daughters mom to another city and they got settled and I came back to visit family elsewhere. 
I remeber it now like it was yesterday smdh.

The very last thing I did was stare at a computer monitor that the pc hardly worked on but was good enough for my daughter to do her work on.
 
With the ribbons screensaver goin 
  Bags packed and my laptop also but in my carryon.. 

When I got home not long after ,, I didn’t even realize what I bought or how .08 or 10 freakin cents turned to 30$ + then 300$ then like what 700$ and now it’s what 30k per 
 No noooo 59k PER as of just few months.

 And I remeber it also that I was advised that’ this is the first time usa ppl can invest into this plz do so now’

Bitcoin was **designed** to be a currency. Spending it on drugs, or the guy who bought a pizza for like 10 bitcoins or whatever - these are examples of **the intended use case** 

Bitcoin as an investment vehicle - which is basically what it has become now, with HODL being the unofficial motto - makes significantly less sense to me.

And it can’t really be both simultaneously, right? One of the primary points of a fungible currency is stability in price. People accepting it in trade for goods and services need to be able to count on the currency being basically the same cost when they get it from a purchaser and when they use it to pay their various expenses. A speculative investment asset is going to fluctuate - it’s just the nature of the beast. 

And arguably if Bitcoin becomes seen more as a speculative investment and less as a currency - and it feels like that’s increasingly the direction we are headed in - it ironically feels like that also hurts Bitcoin as an investment, because it no longer has the draw of its single, underlying principle that made it appealing in the first place. It’s draw was always the decentralized digital currency, right? Well, if it’s just a speculative investment and no longer a currency, what are people investing in? A bubble?

Looking at the logarithmic chart 100k is the very conservative estimate of this bull run, more likely somewhere between 100-200k will be hit though.

This time is different in some ways, and because of that I think the bottom we will crash to following this run may be 30-50k, as some of the institutions will be holding and not selling. I still believe a crash will happen though, it’s just how the cycles seem to work and I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t crash down so the cycle can restart. continued money printing and distrust in banks and governments on a huge scale could possibly extend the bull run or change the cycles though.",t3_m4y2vy,2021-03-15 11:07:27,2021-03-15

3482,gqxw22h,t1_gqwzs39,"Use a longer term volatility measure such as Bollinger bands to find a 'floor' price.

Use a shorter term volatility measure to find a spread. There are lots of ways to do this, I'm inv eff nting a new one just for you. For example, calculate mean and standard deviation on highs and lows from 1 hour intraday candlestick data for one day. Calculate percentage volatility as standard deviation over mean. Do this for each day of past consecutive 30 day month. Average those 30 fractional volatilities. That is your spread as fraction of price.
Set limit orders between 'floor' price and 'current price minus spread'.

After you get fills you can do a similar thing to sell, between an ask price and a ceiling price. However, only sell at most say half, maybe even less, so you HODL half in case bitcoin goes to moon. And when you sell you always try to buy back lower using same method.

This is a risk mitigation strategy. It's not a timing strategy. It doesn't maximuze returns, it seeks to minimize possibility of regret. And its just a variation on that theme that I cooked up in 10 minutes while writing this post.",t3_m4rl4q,2021-03-15 04:45:25,2021-03-15

Nobody knows just a few months ago it crossed $50k for the first time. Bitcoin had a huge rise and then never retraced those high until a few years which is now.

It all depends on your long-term case and if you need that money in the near term or not. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, so we could definitely have more preferable buying opportunities later on.

Personally if you're going to hold and keep holding when it inevitably dips, then I dont think buying at 60k is an issue",t3_m4rl4q,2021-03-15 03:34:52,2021-03-15

Plus I just dont believe in it. Theres no way bitcoin could ever become a safe haven asset if it requires so much to maintain the system. One massive emp burst or even just some downed electrical grid and you’ll be SOL of money. That just seems dumb to me its one thing to have a digital version of a silver certificate like back in the day when money was backed by metals... but this? Its basically fiat 2.0. Thats all. 

Bottom line, crypto is volatile for a reason. Gamble in it if you’d like, but im sticking with things that are far more reliable long term. Plus crypto is way to expensive to fuck around with as is... forget the fact that bitcoin will have ridiculous fees come the time it reaches its max point because minors will bail. 

And in any case the argument about bitcoin being “rare” is dumb seeing as how theres nothing really distinctively unique about it versus other cryptos. People can just make another bitcoin. Ya cant do that with gold. That would be literally against the laws of science, matter cannot be created nor destroyed. Gold is an element. Bitcoin... by its very nature is common and cheap and reproducible. Once people figure that out... it crashes. 

So yeah im not going in any time soon. I dont have that kind of cash. You cant make good money on it unless you put in thousands... i do not recommend putting in your savings. You *will* lose it. Im not saying fiat is any better but bitcoin is not the future. Maybe sovereign backed digital currency that will be forced upon us, but not bitcoin.

3534,gqxwyge,t1_gqxpwyb,"That's a 5.45x39 magazine 100%. There're 4 common types of 7.62x39 mags that forgotten weapons has done a video on, and unless you're in the US where a gun co is making another design like magpul (idk if they make AK mags just using a common example), those are the 4 to look for. That's not any of them and the curve is all wrong for 7.62",t3_m4rl4q,2021-03-15 04:50:43,2021-03-15
3535,gr0ihnd,t1_gqxpwyb,Look at the magazine. The curve of the 74’s mag is not as pronounced as the 47’s. 74’s is straighter. It’s a 74.,t3_m4rl4q,2021-03-15 22:14:23,2021-03-15

You can look at the 1913 Bucharest Agreement to see the latest one. Of course we should've gotten it all back after 100 years, but nope.
