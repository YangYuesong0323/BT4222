The Elites are threatened now because they soon will be unable to make ‚ÄúFees‚Äù or huge profits off of us. Every time we give the banks power to control our money, they have the power to charge us for our money. How many times did the bank charge you fees, or limit how much money you can take out of the ATM per day? How many times did you have to call the fraud department to tell them you actually tried to make a legit transaction?  How many times did you have to deal with an irritating bank employee? 

Taking the power back from the banks (and government) through Bitcoin. The banks, media, and Western Union hate it. They will bow down. The people have spoken.",t3_m16uon,2021-03-18 09:34:07,2021-03-18

90,grc9zoq,t3_m7jnz2,"What do we think BTC's absolute top will be? Personally i think once we hit $1m we are pretty close to the summit, Bitcoin will then be worth almost twice as much as gold which from a fundamentals standpoint makes sense in the event of mass adoption as a global currency. As Michael Saylor explained it performs the function of gold in transferring value over time but also solves the problem gold has of transferring it over space as well. In addition there is a near-infinite amount of gold located in outer space which will be mined to oblivion once we have the means to do so, which will pretty much render gold's function as a store of value obsolete anyway.

Even the S2F model breaks down after the 2028 halving by which only 1.56 BTC will be added to the supply every 10 minutes. By then I think we will be at or pretty close to mass worldwide adoption, volatility will decrease and we will see a much more stable asset that will have much more utility as a currency in everyday transactions.",t3_m7jnz2,2021-03-18 18:58:42,2021-03-18

The next phase will take time - more institutions will announce they buy BTC given that the Fed is predicting inflation - but this isn't 1000% given even though we believe ""it is inevitable"" , hence not yet priced in yet.  Once the inflation numbers actually come in showing higher inflation, BTC will again go up.

402,grcfb9e,t1_grc9zoq,"I think there are two forces driving Bitcoin price:

1. Bitcoin as a store of value infringing on classic stores of value like gold.  This will continue to drive price increases because of the rising volume of buyers from institutional sources.  But, yes, this should top out at some point as the investing world settles on the overall allocation of assets to Bitcoin.  Problem is that it is impossible to predict that point today.  It could be 1M.  It could be 10M.
2. Inflation of fiat currencies.  This drives the price of Bitcoin up, but it's really the deterioration of the value of the fiat side at play.  $$ (or whatever currency) falling in value (ie inflating....) means more $$ to buy a given amount of Bitcoin.  There is no real limit to increases from this factor.  We could inflate our way to a couple million a bitcoin or a trillion a bitcoin - or anywhere in between.  The key factor to keep in mind with inflation, though, is that all $$ prices will be rising for the same reason.  So that loaf of bread might cost $50 or $5000.  At some point it ceases to be relevant to talk about the price of bread in $$$ and instead talk about the price of final goods directly in BTC.",t3_m7jnz2,2021-03-18 20:00:33,2021-03-18

If your bitcoins are in a hybrid wallet and you have no wallet backup, you don't have Bitcoin.

If you don't even remember which wallet your bitcoins are held in or where it is, and your plan is to contact the Bitcoin Corporation to tell you which wallet you've opened and restore everything for you, you don't have Bitcoin.

If you have a wallet backup and password and everything is good, but in your will you have not specified details on how to access the bitcoins... You may have Bitcoin, but if something should ever happen to you, your family doesn't have Bitcoin.

If you believe you have Bitcoin, there's a decent chance you don't have Bitcoin.",t3_m7bmr1,2021-03-18 22:19:27,2021-03-18

If there is fraud or misuse, they can get thier money back with just a simple form. So robinhood and PayPal are EXCELLENT, because they help bridge the gap on the way to decentralized currency for these people who otherwise would not adopt it. These institutions cannot give out private keys because the people they serve will get fleeced into giving them up.

Is your grandma or mom going to be making paper wallets, moving coins to a Trezor and safely storing backup seeds? Nope. For btc to go mainstream there needs to be some trusted third parties involved as custodial agents.  

It's also hypocritical. We trust third parties for literally everything else. Do you have your own email server? Unless you're Hillary Clinton I am guessing you don't and how much of your world is tied to your email... 

So yes- if you are tech savvy absolutely control your own keys.  But to just blindly parrot ""not your keys not your coins"" every time someone brings up PayPal is ridiculous. The fact that PayPal is getting into the crypto game is huge. It's better for crypto than every wannabe reddit crypto genius that gives advice about stuff they don't know about.

1534,grbvqnf,t1_grbbfb2,"Wallet is a confusing term, really. Even withdrawal is confusing. The coins never exist anywhere but on the blockchain. In the chain each coin is associated with an address. You never really ‚Äúsend‚Äù them anywhere when you make a transfer, you just have them reassigned to a new address. The point is that to generate the address and prove it‚Äôs your address (which allows you to make address reassignments - ie to send the coin to a new address, which is equivalent to making a transfer) you need the private keys for that address. So, basically, the private keys are a way for you to prove you own that address, hence the coins associated with it, so you and only you can ‚Äúmove‚Äù them. A wallet, then, is just a way to store the private keys, not the coins. 

All that said, moving back to more familiar language, CB will allow you to withdraw your coins. Therefore you‚Äôre fine with them c.f. Robinhood.

You will hear people say ‚Äúnot your keys, not your coins‚Äù. Recalling what I said above, that means, if anyone other than you knows your private keys then they can control your coins. Take CB as an example, when you go through their withdrawal process, behind the scenes *they* are using the private keys associated with your coins to send the coins to whatever address you tell them, for which you and only you know the private keys.

People have developed both software or hardware wallets that can store the private keys for you. But never use a ‚Äúcustodial wallet‚Äù ie one that keeps your keys and manages them for you, it‚Äôs no different to keeping them on an exchange. Only ever use one that works in such a way that only you has the private keys. A wallet can even a bit of paper with the keys written down / stamped bit of metal - you don‚Äôt necessarily need to use any other software/hardware!

Hopefully it obvious to you that that could be an issue because if they have your private keys then effectively they have control over your coins - and some people are really against that as they could suddenly refuse to let you have them and take ownership of your coins for whatever reason (or if someone hacks them - has been done). It‚Äôs a bit like putting your cash in a bank rather than keeping it at home yourself. 

Now, I would not always be so hardcore because the problem with managing them yourself is you really need to know what you‚Äôre doing as many people have lost their coins. So you really have a decision, do you trust yourself or CB less?!

Anyway, to summarise:

* never use a platform that doesn‚Äôt let you withdraw (or robinhood) as you‚Äôre not really buying coins you‚Äôre buying a promise that they‚Äôll honour the price changes.
* CB does allow withdrawal so no panic for them
* decide whether you trust yourself or the platform to hold your private keys (hold your coins)",t3_m7bmr1,2021-03-18 15:29:08,2021-03-18

 RH has direct control over the margin they keep. That margin did not need to be blown up to the point that their liquidity provider‚Äôs RM had to call it in. RH had multiple options to mitigate the magnitude of their margin and chose not to. The reasonable explanations for that decision are fairly limited. RH‚Äôs RM team should have been on top of this.

I believe that the evidence best supports RH having acted in a rational, unethical manner. I believe that RH allowed an excessive order volume to fulfillment ratio because they believed they could stand to benefit, or at least afford to risk, delayed fulfillment.

There are a ton of regulations about informed investing out there. The base ""tier"" in the US is being an accredited investor, which typically checks that income or non-primary-residence assets exceed a certain threshold before they'll let you invest in certain types of assets (hedge funds, real estate syndications, private equity, etc.). But there are higher classifications of investors above that, like qualified purchaser, eligible contract participant, and so on. I'm not well versed in the specifics here, but it seems entirely plausible to me that they opted to only offer bitcoin to folks who fall into one of those higher categories because it would give them fewer regulatory headaches at first, while also giving them first-mover PR advantage among big banks.

2560,grd4tgb,t1_grcsvhi,"I guess, if they‚Äôre an aggregate site, it‚Äôs possible that they lost connection to one API and didn‚Äôt think to adjust the denominator for the loss, but put the value of that sites $/BTC at zero, skewing the average/aggregate. This happens when you let the computer decide to do, when you get a NULL return. If that wasn‚Äôt a clear hopeful this example will help:

Exchange A,B,C (3 exchanges) are all reporting 55k/BTC. So the average becomes (55k+55k+55k)/3=55k. Suddenly, connection drops to Exchange B, and the API returns ‚ÄúNULL‚Äù or possible ‚ÄúFALSE‚Äù. As the connection has dropped, the equation should change to (55k+55k)/2=55k (as the number of exchanges has now changed). But when you don‚Äôt code the appropriate handler for NULL or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù returns, your script *could* interpret the return (or lack there of) as zero. This would result in an equation of (55k+0+55k)/3=36.667k. Of course the more exchanges you have, the smaller effect that zero would have on the average. As a side note, you can avoid this kind of error by counting your non-zero non-Null returns as using that as a denominator, instead of just deciding that the count of your array of exchanges is always going to be functional.

I have sold more BTC than I own and have just gotten over the regret.

I kept wishing I could tell my younger self to buy more BTC back in the early days.  Then I tried to listen what my future self was telling me what to do. The answer was ""Buy more BTC"" b/c with every central bank printing money BTC will become more valuable, Just like land, famous art, precious metals.

Also, they're buying something that literally everyone else can decide to sell at the same time too. The control they have over equities, which, as we've seen over the last two months with the GME debacle is considerable, does not exist in Bitcoin.

My whole issue with people going in with Bitcoin is not that they do not do it AT ALL. It's with the idea of getting in at 55k. If it was 2010, you had the stones to throw a few G's on the future, you're a speculative hero and I'm genuinely thrilled for you. Even a year ago at 5K. 

It's about right now. Do many retail investors have huge liquidity to invest at these prices? No. If you think it's going to 200K you stand to make 4x on whatever investment you make. These people would be better served by a myriad of other investment products. But the fact that 1 coin is 50k and people are saying it'll be 200K -- they're losing sight of that simple arithmetic. 

I believe that Bitcoin is approaching saturation meaning that most people (who are available to play this game) have at least some idea of the thing. This is the height of that fervor.

I start approaching it as an investment.

I then am educated as to why it's more than that as you're saying.

I then discuss it as a revelatory new adaptation of the world which sees it replace our traditional financial system and render the subject-to-inflation-dollar (and friends) useless.

Then someone tells me that they'll never sell it and instead plan to take loans against their balance in their local currency.

Then another guy tells me that it is going to replace the current financial system and its problems despite the largest wallets being held by a very small number of people. The new 1%.

Then someone tells me I should listen to podcasts and watch content made by the whales as to why it is valuable and I am an idiot to not have...

And then the cycle goes on until you arrive.

So is it an investment, is it a replacement of fiat currency, is it a thing to hold indefinitely because it ""stores"" value (which I still disagree with although I understand how/why people are saying so), is it a short term rocket to 5/10/15x your money?

Also, when you say is it a replacement for fiat, I have to wonder if you've even looked at other coins. I personally don't see BTC as a fiat replacement. Most people, I think, now see it as a replacement for gold and an inflationary hedge. There's a lot of other coins, all serving different purposes, that you could look at as a potential replacement for currency. XLM comes to mind as a good replacement for currency, although it's primary purpose seems to be in low cost remittances from people back to relatives in their home country.

So even other coins are only replacements under certain circumstances. BATS are money for your attention to intermet ads. Civic is money that verifies your identity. There's even a coin that tracks and verifies the authenticity of wine bottles. Theres MANA which is like videogame money in a Minecraft like placed called Decentraland.

It is all so much more than you appear to be aware of which, no offense, makes your posts kind of suspect. Because I then wonder if you have time to write these ultra long arguments back and forth about what bitcoin really is, fighting like hell the idea it can keep going up without ever mentioning how much is up for grabs in the gold and bond markets, then asking if BTC is a replacement for currency (my answer is no cause of the energy requirements and fees, maybe for large cross border transactions), it makes me wonder how much you've actually researched crypto and DeFi in general.

How do you value a global currency that could potentially revolutionize the entire financial system? What draws the line between speculation and reality? Are price prediction charts made in 2014 accurate simply because they exist and some people are aware of them or is their truth in the math/theory? I think there is a very subliminal battle that‚Äôs being fought with Bitcoin. With charts, graphs and comparing to growth of stocks- the media treats it like an investment. It can be used to grow wealth- and in turn, that is how it spreads right? But if the global financial system moved entirely to Bitcoin- would not all wealth generated be valued by the currency? It would in a sense be limitless- if that happens.

These are things I thought about immensely when I dove down the rabbit hole in May of 2017. Then last year Michael Saylor comes out reiterating a lot of these conclusions amongst many more, adding his own weight/gravity to the currency by owning billions.
