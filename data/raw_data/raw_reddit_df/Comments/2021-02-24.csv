6,gol5rg5,t3_lr7cbr,"Hi all,


I have been in lockdown for 9 months out of the last 12. I live in a small flat, it's literally like being in low security prison.

I am an extremely outgoing person, generally, my job involved meeting 30ish strangers everyday and engaging them to participate in projects but during lockdown I became agoraphobic, to the point where I would be staring at my feet for hours , trying to go to the shop to get food, terrified of the eye contact I might get if I went out.
I had been smoking too much weed, more than before and have basically smoked everyday since I was 18 (26 now). I had also been consuming too much of other items. My mood was becoming erratic and I feared for my sanity.

At the beginning of this month I began weekly DCA and educated myself on blockchain. I feel so much more productive, I'm sleeping and having positive dreams for the first time in 8 years. I'm working out, I'm in contact with my friends from childhood.

I feel like I have my life back and people around here have been a part of that, them helping me and me helping them.

Thanks all, with love :)",t3_lr7cbr,2021-02-24 22:56:48,2021-02-24

Take 50% of my profits stick it into a hard wallet give it to my 4yr old daughter with the key to the wallet to be time released when she turns 18.  


She will either be:  
\- Filthy rich, never have to work.  
\- Will have to work and have enough to cover college.  
\- Beer money at best.  
\- Asking me why I was dumb enough to invest in something which is worth 0 now!

Tesla + Micro + Square ~ $4B into Bitcoin, 1/5 of the $20 Bil new.

This is elasticity.

Now private money is at least equal to public. $1.5 Bil Tesla = $1.5 Bil Elon / Board members / Order takers, etc.

---

Rate of flow at $100k is $30 Bil, or $100 Bil at $300k.

A surge of $40 Bil coming in, could shoot to $300k price.

Like $20 Bil more public... 

---

Prediction - we are at $5 Bil public money announced... if we get to $25 Bil total public money by Dec, we might hit a $300k price.

To sustain $300k, we need $100 Bil total investment, per year, for 3 years - or maybe like $30 Bil expected from publics, if only tracking publics - to sustain $300k.

That's a lot more doable than I thought, before Musk and Saylor.

---

$50k is a very safe price I think, $150k is totally sensible, and $300k if they all try to pile in.

To be less than $50k we need like less than $4 Bil public money per year, which I can't see happening.

&#x200B;

1. You're getting a currency that is constantly inflating (USD/GBP) and rapidly becoming worthless
2. It's a taxable event
3. You may not get in again at a lower price

You should consider the effect of tax on your 'profit' (you may end up with a walloping tax bill at the end of the year that you were not expecting) and also risk adjust the 'profit'.

In short... before you blindly listen to traders with tiny cocks who like to shout ""take profits""... you have to consider all of that stuff and other things too. It isn't easy to do profitably - and that's why lots  of youtube traders make more money selling 'lessons' in their discord. LOL.

Also, traders are generally full of shit about prices and are making it up (and trying to pump things they own).

That's why when you look at the bitcoin price over time, it makes far more sense for ordinary people to do the following: **BUY. HODL. Never sell.**

And if you ever need liquidity, **get some financial advice** on how to borrow against your bitcoin. That's how rich people stay rich. By owning assets that consistently go up in value and then borrow against it (and because it's a loan, not paying tax) - and then refinance when the asset has gone up in value again AND keep the asset (bitcoin in this case. could also be painting, football teams).

3520,gojcl1w,t1_goj7l0o,"yeah, it's easy

identify the lowest dip by when you see it start to rise again, then go back in time and buy the dip",t3_lqopxj,2021-02-24 10:17:38,2021-02-24
3521,gokg7ci,t1_goj7l0o,"Yes, definitely. As soon as you see steamboat on the bitcoin horizon waiting for you to take you over a huge lake sell. Then buy back at the middle of the lake. It's that simple.",t3_lqopxj,2021-02-24 18:02:16,2021-02-24
3522,gokqfef,t1_goj8k30,"hey, thanks!

yeah that's what ive been doing. just buying at the dips at every opportunity i have. my question isn't specifically about bitcoin but just generally.

so i suppose the answer is, if timing is perfect, then yes, it's better to sell before the dips. but of course no way we can predict all these dips and peaks, and hence, DAC is the better strategy, right?",t3_lqopxj,2021-02-24 20:30:44,2021-02-24
3525,gojmsj9,t1_gojcl1w,Yeah people it‚Äôs not that hard!  Just look into the future - from your point of view üòâ- and confirm that the low point you‚Äôre in at that moment is indeed the lowest point that will occur in the future too.  That‚Äôs what makes it the LOWEST point in the dip.  Duh!  /s,t3_lqopxj,2021-02-24 11:44:24,2021-02-24
