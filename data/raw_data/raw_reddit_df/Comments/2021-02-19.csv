I think you're being a little dramatic here.  I've also been HODLing (and selling) the stuff I mined in 2011.  I still have about 1/3 of my original stash, sold off some in 2015 to cover my original costs, sold some more during the big rise in 2017, and a bit whenever it was above $10K over the last few years.  All told, I averaged about $9000/BTC for the 2/3; an amount that, if BTC went to zero tomorrow, I'd be perfectly happy with what I managed to pull out, but the remaining 1/3 is currently worth 3x what I had taken out before.

I tried to start mining on my shitty laptop but I couldn't get it to work so I gave up, I signed up to Coinbase but never deposited anything because I thought I was too late. When I finally bought in 2017 and saw that my Coinbase account was many years old and empty I really hated myself for not buying sooner, I could have prevented my family from going through some tough financial times which is the most painful thing but I was too lazy and didn't take action soon enough. Would have been life changing. I guess this is just one of many similar stories... I put some savings into Bitcoin in 2017 and in a few years I should have enough for a deposit on a house so I'm still incredibly grateful and Bitcoin taught me to be less lazy and not let good opportunities pass by.

I will be keeping an eye on this type of 'borrowing product' and hope to see more built out in the coming period of time.

Like take a mental snapshot of wins and misplays, see if there is a lesson to learn there, perhaps ""ah fuck in hindsight that was greedy/panicky"" but then move on. There's no fault in not being psychic, and almost no one would have held until their ideal time that they've picked with hindsight, you'd have sold way earlier if you needed the money and I'd you didn't chances are you'd have held too long past the ATH anyway. 

Now memeing about billion dollar pizzas is fun, but if anyone reading out there is falling for this mental ""trap"" seriously, don't. The symptoms of this range from being mildly annoying to everyone around you to essentially losing your mind and sleep constantly checking charts. The goal of all of this for pretty much all of us is to better our lives. Be it financial freedom for those of us with enough to risk, or even if you can only put in $50-100 and can't realistically change your life with that money in today's market, it would be dope to add another 0 to that. However, money isn't worth the stress of destroying your mental well-being. Accept that you are not a psychic, celebrate the wins, learn from the loses, and move on.

I mined LTC and Dogecoin in pools.  And I used to convert to btc on btc-e and cryptsy (I luckily got out of enough before both shutdown but even the leftover coins in there, I wish I had back.  

Incredible Dogecoin was .00015 back then and bitcoin around $700. I used all my christmas money from multiple peope to buy 1 bitcoin and my mom yelled at me for such a stupid purchase, was a great decision.

Even better was my dogecoin value increase 44000% to 55000% when I sold it, out pacing even BTC far outpacing LTC I bought a retirement property with my crypto.

I remember needing a car body work done (car ran fine just didn't look good) I sold 1 BTC to fix a car that drove fine in 2014 ish

I traded 20 ETH for XVG, ada, dent/digibyte in 2017 or 2018 Jan  (I think Mcafee pumped up Verge to crazy levels)  

I remember paying something like 1,000,000 Dogecoin for 5x pcie riser extentions for my milk crate miner (and looking behind grocery stores for milk crates, that's what we used back in the day for an open case.  Those 1000000 Dogecoin is worth 60k for 5 fucking pcie risers.

Here in the states we pay tiered electricity costs so after tier 2/3 I was paying 800 in electricity per month, and I didn't want to sell coins, so I put a few computers at my parents place with teamviewer to check remotely as I had  flashed the bios and tweaked the voltage to get it to hash as much as possible.  Imagine when a computer crashes and I had to have my mom troubleshoot it over the phone (she didn't even know how to turn it on).  I luckily had wake on Lan and could send a magic packet to wake it but if not I had to have mom remote troubleshoot it.  My parents were wtf is wrong with our electricity. 

I also lost some BTC trading it, paper hands back then.  Little did I know how much that would be.  I can't complain the experience was something else.  Oh I also traded hardware on overclockers and anandtech forums and I turned down BTC and LTC multiple times for old cpu, gpu, memory etc from 2010-2012.

Nature did well enough to feck things up before we picked up the banner.

Everyone is an investor, but maybe not by professions or in the conventional sense of the word. So at least he is honest about it. But all of us invest something all the time. All the time.

Which is from where the ""time is money"" saying comes from. It stems from time being more or less impossible to control as a resource.  


Musk invested his time to become a technological engineer, just like I myself invested my time to become a biological engineer. And maybe that makes him even more credible, since he can see the financial system from another perspective.  
I am also positive that he has a lot of pressure to watch his tongue as one of the most influential people on this planet. He has a lot of angry dogs trying to bite his tail.

You've hit the nail on the head!

Most civilisations have existed without a medium of exchange - so long as take in the true breadth of human history, not just the last 10,00 years (although even then I think the statement is quite strong).

We only see widescale adoption of a medium of exchange with the emergence of the state, often in tandem with the emergence of armies. The barter economy to a monetary economy theory is a myth that has been contradicted heavily by anthropological and archeological evidence. No one has been able to find an example of a barter society. Barter occurs between civilisations which are hostile to each other or do not have well established relations. Within civilisations, resources shared according to ability and need has been the norm. Sharing, in a word. Communism, if you want to use an edgier word. Although anarchism would be a better descriptor.

Check out chapter 2 of [this book](https://libcom.org/files/__Debt__The_First_5_000_Years.pdf) if you want more on an anthropologist talking about the myth of barter. David Graeber has lots of easy to watch lectures on Youtube too on the topic.

(If anyone reading this and wants more, [this podcast episode](https://livagar.substack.com/p/cryptocurrency-and-the-end-of-capitalism) talks about Graeber's critique of the theory of barter in the context of Bitcoin. There's some really interesting anti-state leftist analysis of bitcoin starting to emerge that cuts through the Randian hype machine.)",t3_ln5la2,2021-02-19 18:14:23,2021-02-19

3713,gnzxky6,t1_gnzs86q,"Of course. No one said it was easy. I thought letting some of my GBTC go for 40+% premiums to NAV was smart in December. Turns out the price of BTC just kept going up and it didn't matter that the premium cratered to 5-10% because GBTC is still 50-60% above where I was selling it just 2-months later. 

Of course, if we go back to 25k in the near term, I'll feel great about those sales.

You've just gotta have a system. I accumulate GBTC when premium is single digits to NAV and begin selling when it gets above 20-25 over NAV. This worked well all throughout 2019 and 2020. I was able to reduce the position multiple times at high premiums and rebuild it at low premiums increasing my total position while actually reducing the total $ at risk. But this hasn't been working well for the last 3-5 months as sales proved to be too early ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it's a system. I'm going to follow it. In an IRA, taxes aren't an issue so I'm willing to trade this frequently. 

Similar story with BTC. I buy when Mayer Multiple is at 2.25 or below and HODL between 2.25 and 2.75 and trim when it gets closer to 3. I'm not flipping the entire position - just trimming a few percentage points. If it persists and we go higher, I sell a few percentage points more. Always with limit orders back closer 2.25x to catch dips and consolidations. I'm not doing this to miss 10% dips - I'm doing it with the understanding the faster that we run further, the more risk of a large correction there is. 

Maybe I make more money doing this. Maybe I make less. But it's a system to reduce the risk inherent in something that has historically had spectacular booms followed by spectacular busts.",t3_ln5la2,2021-02-19 19:58:36,2021-02-19

If you read the early writings of Satoshi and his detractors (seriously, most all the same arguments against bitcoin were being presented at only a few months old), it's a little more clear what the intention was. He wasn't looking to make an immediate medium of exchange. He predicted it would get there eventually but not immediately.

I kept buying and only now I see huge margins of profit, 3 years later.

4323,go053h7,t3_ln9m61,"Just so people know, I don't advise doing this. I've been in since 1 BTC was under $1 (late 2010, early 2011). On a grand time scale Bitcoin is a baby. Under 15 years is nothing. Like it or not, this technology *is* still experimental. It's unique to the world and nobody knows what will ultimately happen. Yes, I believe chances of things working out are greater than not, but that's not guaranteed. As mentioned before the smartest people involved here have made giant mistakes. In 2018 a **severe** [vulnerability](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/#:~:text=CVE%2D2018%2D17144%2C%20a,and%20a%20critical%20inflation%20vulnerability.&text=At%20this%20time%20we%20believe,has%20upgraded%20to%20patched%20nodes.) was lurking under the surface. Who knows if Bitcoin would have survived it if a different course of action was taken by those who found and dealt with it. We don't know if something similar exists or will exist in the future. Bugs are simply the nature of software because humans make mistakes. 

Rich people *diversify*, and that's what I advise too. Look at holding *physical* precious metals for protection against inflation. Look at other cryptocurrencies. Some go up at different rates than BTC, but more importantly diversification protects from problems which may arise on one network. One problem is unlikely to affect all similar platforms. That's why I also advise spreading coins over different exchanges, to the extent coins are left on exchanges (which in general they shouldn't be). I think it's fine to go ""all in"" on hopes of sizable returns, provided one is prepared to ride ups and downs and even be at peace with an unlikely total loss. However, a well thought out diversity strategy, I think, adds strength to one's position.",t3_ln9m61,2021-02-19 21:27:58,2021-02-19

Just HODL and welcome to the ride OP.",t3_ln9m61,2021-02-19 21:19:58,2021-02-19

It's just a bad idea, from an investment point of view, to buy something in the ATH, especially when in the last 3 months the price increased almost 5 times of what it was before. 

But apparently that's the time that every person which is new in the market decides to buy. It's also the time that you see news about it everywhere.  
How many times did that happen? A lot. How many threads we have from people that bought during ATH and then had to hold for a few years until they finally have a profit? A lot.

There are a lot of topics talking about that, how to handle FOMO and so on.

But no. Here we have Zabado222 with the brilliant advice to buy and hold, because in 5, 10 or 20 years it will pay off. Then he can come here and say : ""SEE, I TOLD YOU? JUST HODL!!!"" 

Right on buddy!",t3_ln9m61,2021-02-19 22:16:06,2021-02-19
