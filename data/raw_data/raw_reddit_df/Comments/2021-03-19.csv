Rang Shitbank. First customer ""service"" rep basically said: ""Ohhhhhhh, crypto is dangerous. You'll loose your money."" To which I asked if this was an official stance by Shitbank or his personal opinion. Didnt really get a definitive answer.

Rang Shitbank again. Got a much better rep. He said that Shitbank wouldnt block transactions. However, he confirmed that they advise people not to buy crypto because you loose money.

He suggested that I call back and talk to tech support to do a deep dive on my account. I didnt. This felt really intrusive. Instead Ive been looking for a better work around. Great to find this thread.

Then they want you to invest and rape you with their fees in this ETF, which you do not own any crypto, you don‚Äôt get any dividends and when you want to realise profits in case the ETF does well in the future, they get their fees just because they have a name and reunited all these companies in the ETF.

Few points. All of them taken from Thomas Sowell's book Basic Economics:
1.	(this one is not intuitive) Wages going up slower than inflation does not necessarily mean less buying power, because in capitalist countries the goods are actually getting cheaper and more functional. The car you could buy 50 years ago is crap compared to the car you can buy now. 
2.	Corporations are not the problem (I agree on the government part). Corporations only gain wealth by providing value. They simply cannot confiscate money from people (like the government) - the only way for them to get your money is to offer you something that is worth more to you than the money you give up. In fact corporations are one of the primary reason wealthy countries are so far ahead of poor ones - because they allow great massive enterprises to be taken up that would not be possible by individuals. Countries rich with many resources but without sufficiently developed economic systems to enable stock markets and corporations remain poor.

Because of the Cantillon effect, and the number of steps the printed money takes to reach farmers, these are among the lowest numbers you find.

What about when minimum wage is less than half of what it would be had it maintained pace with inflation?  I understand from what you said it doesn't necessarily need to go up 1:1 with inflation but less than half the pace in comparison?  That seems bad since its all based on the same fiat system.  

I feel like the perceived increase in buying power is due to cheaper goods but goods are largely only getting cheaper because we get them through slave wage workers in other countries.  Something we should ban but then we run into the next problem, producing products on US soil (or somewhere workers are paid livable, up to date, wages).

The reason its so hard to produce products in the US is because of the wage requirements in this country, which is ironic.  So we can't pay proper wages because that would require us to sell products at the proper inflated price, which people wouldn't be able to afford due to their wages not keeping up with the cost of ethically producing goods.

more about the damn international tax cartel mafia

The trend in international taxation, I would say, is a kind of ‚ÄúStates Cartel‚Äù, against taxpayers. The role of the OECD, which has been in the past to enhance and sustain economic exchanges between its Member states, has become an instrument through which tax competition between States is prevented.

States tend to prevent tax competition and thus create a kind of ‚Äúcartel‚Äù in order to keep certain States from implementing a more favourable tax regime than others.

I highly recommend you read Basic Economics as there are no equations there - because it will show you the flaws in the logic most people employ like thinking that some labour is ""slave labour"" or that minimum wage laws are a good thing. I know certainly for me I changed my mind on both of those topics after reading it. 
But the short explanation is that the alternative to ""slave labor"" in most poor countries is dumpster diving and many of those people pay bribes must to get into those positions, most of which pay more than double the local wage. The reason why companies don't pay more has to do with skill and efficiency (due to bad roads for example) in poor countries - after all if they had same things we have here they wouldn't be poor. 
Regarding minimum wage it is the most evil law one could create for it is both racist, sexist and all kids of discriminatory. Let's say you are a minority and I'm a racist. If there is no minimum then you can come to me and offer to work for me for $1 per hour less. If I don't hire you out of discrimination then I HAVE to pay the cost of discriminating against you for every hour I'm employing a white person instead of you. However, if the wage I HAVE to pay is $15/hr and if that's what I'm paying a for a given position, then my choice is between a minority and a white person - both of which cost me the same. Now I am free to discriminate.

Their broader argument is that the United States, and other world economies, has a vested interest in the USD remaining strong. The Fed uses monetary policy to keep inflation artificially low, which people would argue will eventually fail leading to hyperinflation. A weakness of the USD ‚Äúred pill‚Äù moment if you will.

There was no USSR, there was no pre 1945 world, at least not when they're arguing about the US.  The US always was in control, particularly when blame is to be ascribed.

So they take for granted beneficial things that exist (which the US provides), and rail about negative things that those beneficial things necessitate (which the US takes in return).  In this case, they will rail about the US ""having reserve currency power"", but assume that any change will still have the US buy their stuff.  Because even if we change the former, the latter is so part of their worldview, that it obviously will not change.  The US will continue to provide certain guarantees while the world changes the terms of engagement with it.  Somehow.

You see the same thing with assumptions of US military restraint - it's basically assumed that in any conflict, the antagonistic country against the US will be fine with almost total war scenarios in strikes against the US, but the US will, of course, have some kind of restraint in response.  Usually this is couched in terms of some mystical  ""the US has more to lose"" paradigm, but you'll amusingly even find the rare person arguing this point so strongly that in their war game scenarios, some enemy of the US is permitted to like nuke half the US, but the US doesn't fire back because they're ""afraid of losing global trade"" or some such nonsense.

Now in year 2021, all you hear is FUD. India's finance minister said on a live interview that they will not ban it completely. They will leave a window open to experiment, to analyse and accordingly proceed how bitcoin and blockchain can benefit India.

All these FUD articles have an extensive abuse of words like 'might', 'may', only to cause panic without a solid proof.",t3_m8do5v,2021-03-19 18:13:07,2021-03-19

The real problem is they have a government that got elected on the promise of beating up minorities within the country. That was somehow going to make ""India great again"". You have heard that one before right?

So the country has an excellent young world class engineering pool held back and frustrated by the incompetent political class who for some reason are dictated to by the Reserve bank of India about Bitcoin instead of the engineering intellectuals. As you can see the hierarchy is paranoid about Bitcoin and hence the FUD and bashing continues.

This should be interesting to watch in the next decade a whole country fail to step into the next generation of technology and economics. It is a sad story in the making.",t3_m8do5v,2021-03-19 22:05:15,2021-03-19
