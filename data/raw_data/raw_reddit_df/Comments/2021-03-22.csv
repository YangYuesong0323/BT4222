A good place to start: https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html  

> is it a hot wallet?  

yes  

> how to backup  

This really depends on the particular wallet that you are using. In general, you have to write down the 12/24 words, just as with any regular wallet. Backing up channels is a bit more tricky, I'm not sure if there is a common standard to do this but I haven't kept up either.  

> if I create a $1 channel, can I receive $2 or more ?  

No, also in order to receive anything, you need to have inbound channel balance (so in order to receive $1, your counterparty needs at least $1 on their side). This can be achieved by multiple ways, f.ex simply spending something within your channel, or rebalance manually, or paying someone to open up a channel with inbound liquidity etc.",t3_magmfu,2021-03-22 21:57:04,2021-03-22

No, that verification process is baked into the system, and the mempool has assigned it as a confirmed tx and thus now only in the blockchain 'record' not the next block of txs waiting to be confirmed.

The turmoil came despite an attempt by the bank’s new governor, Sahap Kavcioglu, on Sunday to reassure markets by saying taming inflation is its main objective. Mr. Kavcioglu had been installed late Friday by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day after the central bank had increased interest rates.

In Asian trading hours Monday, the first chance markets had to react to the news, the lira fell from 7.219 per dollar to as low as 8.280, before regaining some ground to stand at 8.055 per dollar by early afternoon Hong Kong time, according to FactSet. In November it hit a record closing low at 8.5249, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Max Lin, an emerging-markets currency strategist at NatWest Markets, said the personnel change sent a clear signal that President Erdogan doesn’t want to maintain high interest rates to contain inflation. “In the past we have seen the Turkish government change central bank governors basically because they were unhappy with [the bank’s] hawkish interest-rate policy, so now it looks like there’s a reversion to that,” he said.

Mr. Lin said foreign investors were likely to sell Turkish assets, such as bonds, in anticipation of low interest rates and rapid inflation. “High inflation erodes currency competitiveness,” he said.

In a note to clients, Société Générale foreign-exchange strategist Phoenix Kalen said Turkey has lost “one of its last remaining anchors of institutional credibility.” Ms. Kalen said local individual investors would rush to stock up on dollars again and foreign investors were likely to sell Turkish assets. “Turkey may soon be headed toward another currency crisis,” she wrote.

Central banks exacerbate that problem by taking bad loans(a **significiant** part of many banks liabilities) off the same banks balance sheet, which enables the banks to issue more credit. So yes, central banks debase the currency by enabling private banks.

The thing is they do so for a **very** good reason. In a economy where many actors ability to function relies on refinancing of debt, or at the very least said debt not being called you **have** to keep banks liquid. The risk of a chain reaction is very, very real. If bad debtors go down they can pull previously good debtors down with them, think millions of employees with mortgages getting unemployed because their company is insolvent.

It’s a fairly tricky situation, no single entity is at fault for all of it. In the end the problem could be summed up as a debt repayment problem. The ones with the debt don’t have the money to repay them, the ones that could repay the debt don’t have any. It’s a money allocation problem. We have three classes of people:

1.	Debtors
2.	Debtee
3.	Wealthy

Private commercial banks were told they can do whatever they want and regulate their behavior based on the occultic 'invisible hand' Adam Smith and selfishness was perfectly good as espoused by Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman in the 70s 80s. This meant that the banks could inflate credit against \*existing\* assets based on arbitrary criteria that they themselves judged. For example you bought a home for $10k and post it for sale a few years later for $20k. The bank gave the new borrower $20k of \*new\* credit on INTEREST against an asset that has deteriorated over time because of natural entropy. Where did your $10k of profit come from? Nowhere. There is no new productivity added to back the capital gains you made. You can now spend \*newly\* created unbacked money into the existing economy. The new money is IOU claims against the actual economy which is now burdened to meet the ever increasing demand of the counterfeit credit. This is where the inflation comes from. Its from the government being taken over by the free market.

When this libertarian ponzi goes BUST(2001,2008,2020), the dumbass professors that run the fed, people who have never seen more then $50 in real money in their lifetimes, people with mortgages and miserious behavior RUSH to bailout the banking system by creating more new money to buy the previously worthless bonds. They do not understand the source of the issues.

The root of this entire system is not the government but the private sector run for the 'selfish' interests of a few people. The nation state government is the last thing protecting YOU from total enslavement to wealthy private individuals. It has been attacked for decades now and the results for the population at large have been catastrophic.

Bitcoin is an attack against the US for the benefit of tech-finance oligarchs, they want the power to control money so they complete their domination over you. They want a digital system where the top few control all the funds and a transparent database that sees everything you are spending on, in order to datamine and use AI algos to steer you towards their interests. Bitcoin \*IS\* the introduction of this, get people comfortable with the idea of a \*private\* money system to use along side a \*private\* information system(facebook, twitter). The guys who control this become the new government with \*no\* checks on their power.

Crypto currencies are regression backwards to primitive top down oligarchies that dominated europe for centuries.

Bitcoin takes this to a new step where you are told to give all your paychecks to the 50 people who sell cryptos 24/7 and buy up real assets with the money that you gave them. They are all BASED on Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand and Murrary Rothbard delusional theories. You need to learn to THINK.",t3_mahb23,2021-03-22 21:24:06,2021-03-22

Bitcoin has destroyed lives and has liberated no one. Ask yourself WHO is selling you bitcoin for DOLLARS? If fiat is worthless why are bitcoin holders selling for dollars?

Bitcoin is \*not\* a revolution against the status quo, it is a further \*degeneration\* of it. It comes from Murray Rothbard and Milton Friedman who viewed man as animals.

There are different difficulty levels for different alt-coins.
It could hash whatever alt coin was profitable like nicehash does.  My 3060 is making the equivalent of about 4 US dollars a day and my 1660 super is making about 3.

The Xbox has a modern gpu design that is manufactured on a modern process.  I would imagine it's built for efficiency over power usage.  It won't be some monster hashing, but if it is profitable, it's profitable.  According to what I've read, it's of similar compute power to my RTX 3060.

The bigger question in my mind would be if the cooling design spec would allow that type of workload without causing a new epidemic of RROD.

Same with in-game marketplaces for selling/trading skins and items. You got a rare skin from a loot box and want to make money off of it without having to go to a separate platform?

Power has very little to do with mining capability especially when talking about Ethereum- often times you can run Ethereum mining under the wattage the card runs at stock. If you are talking about multiple cards, then power comes into play so that you don’t overload the circuit you’re running on with the sheer number of cards you’re trying to run. 6 3080s would be about the equivalent of running a space heater power wise. Stock it’s about 300w per card, mining Ethereum is 235w when properly tuned. At 100MH/s per card, that’s about $275/mo per card at current rates after electricity. From the comments it’s become very clear that there are massive misconceptions about mining. You can fact check me at www.NiceHash.com’s profitablity calculator for the electric rates in your local area if you want. I’m just trying to spread the knowledge because I believe this tech will benefit everyone. Misinformation only hurts humanity, I encourage you to ensure the information you spread is based in reality, even when hypothesizing the theoretical hash rate of an Xbox.

Power consumed by an individual mining device does not scale directly with hash rate and profitability, it depends more on the generation, computing power, efficiency and capability of the device. An AMD RX570 consumes 95w tuned - 130w stock to get 30.5MH/s. A 1070 consumes 140w and hashes at 25.2MH/s.

That popularity is reflected in its market cap. Its biggest attribute in the crypto space is its market cap, which in turn gives it the ability to consume its competitors. If you were a company, and you had the ability to let your players use either bitcoin or enjin, which would you choose? If you as a player had the choice to play a game that rewarded either enjin or bitcoin, which would you choose? This of course is assuming that neither enjin nor bitcoin has an advantage as far as utility goes. With TLN and other future capabilities that bitcoin could adopt, I see that as a fair assumption. In that case, I think bitcoin wins in a landslide. 

It’s the ultimate argument for why bitcoin is THE coin, and every other coin will eventually fail or fall into a niche market. If anything is threatening bitcoin’s market cap, it will eliminate that threat. It will of course have to make sacrifices and give certain coins a piece of the pie, but in the grander scheme of things it will always come out on top.

2230,grt4npw,t3_mandjt,"In the endless reaches of cyberspace, there once existed a planet known as “Crypto”. A planet that glowed with an ever-changing sequence of code. There, civilization was far advanced, giving way to a group of cypherpunk scientists with an idea that could change the cyber-verse forever.. The cypherpunks developed decentralized technologies to the absolute peak of cryptographic perfection.. on the verge of a breakthrough to free all cyber citizens from the clutches of the Ruling Hand and its evil henchmen - the Piggy Bankers and Middle Men monitoring & profiting off every cyber transaction. But, there came a day when the Ruling Hand threatened to destroy planet Crypto forever, in its never-ending conquest for total cyber domination. The cypherpunks, sensing the approach of doom, gathered for a final feast, to craft a plan to ensure the survival of their greatest invention, the culmination of centuries of cryptographic progress. By unanimous consensus, they concluded to send their newest member, the young Satoshi Nakamoto to bring this technology to planet earth. Satoshi’s Father (Man Fox) & mother (Love Hash) placed the young Satoshi in a space pod, stepped back and watched as it launched in the direction of earth just before planet crypto exploded. Satoshi’s pod flew through meme-studded cyberspace, passing the dankest of memes at incredible speed, landing safely on earth with the cyber-verse’s only hope for freedom from the Ruling Hand’s reign of terror. Satoshi was first adopted by earth’s very own cypherpunks, a small community of freedom-loving cryptographers. As the years went by, Satoshi grew to maturity and found himself possessed of amazing cryptographic powers. Faster than a run on the banks! More anonymous…than ""Anonymous!"" Destroyer of middle men and protector of cyber freedom! Look up in the sky! It’s a rocket! It’s a UFO! No, it’s Super Satoshi!

2627,grtatkm,t1_grsvmxt,"You can buy bitcoin now or you can buy a contract which says you would like to buy bitcoin for a certain price at some point in the future, essentially gambling that the price moves in a way you want.

If you expect the price to increase, you'd buy a call option. If the price of bitcoin is $100, and you buy a contract for 1 bitcoin for the price of $100 and the price increases to $200 you can sell the contract to someone else for a bit more, or you can exercise the contract and buy the bitcoin for $100. All contracts have an expiration date, and you cannot exercise the contract after the expiry.

Put options are when you expect the price to decrease. They are a little different in that instead of buying, you would sell a set number of bitcoin defined in the contract at some predefined price (this price is called the strike price for both put and call options). So you buy a put option which lets you sell 1 bitcoin for $100. If the price decreases you will make money off the difference (you pay a certain ""premium"" in order to own the contract). These also have expiration dates.

Usually large investment companies issue contracts which expire at set dates. Not sure how they do it with bitcoin, but with regular stock it's the third friday of every month or something like that (most likely the same for bitcoin).

Why would anyone do this? Because options is very high risk and very high reward. Instead of buying pennies worth of bitcoin to hold for 6 years, you buy a contract which makes you eligible for 1000 btc that you can make money off of in just a month.

**Behind every single one of these contracts there must exist bitcoin in order to exercise. When you exercise, the issuer of the contract will have to actually buy the bitcoin, unless they already own it and can just issue it (I reckon this is more likely with currencies).** This is what makes the price increase or decrease accordingly.

Disclaimer: I've never done this with a currency, but I suspect the process is more or less the same. Not sure whether BTC options is a very popular mechanic at all.",t3_malcqn,2021-03-22 22:22:06,2021-03-22

Let's just say it stayed the same, and let's say Bitcoin mining uses 100Twh.

Bitcoin processes around 7 transactions per second or so on chain.

VISA processed 1141 transactions per second (amortized) in [2019 page 2](https://s1.q4cdn.com/050606653/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/Visa-Inc.-Q4-2019-Financial-Results.pdf)

Mastercard processed 2758 transactions per second (amortized) in [2019 page 6 ""switched transactions?""](https://s25.q4cdn.com/479285134/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/2019-Annual-Report-on-Form-10-K.pdf).

3028,grrkcpo,t3_ma3hdh,"It's the second post that's the more considered in the screencap. Satoshi understood a basic truth about humans - that we do wasteful things in order to gain utility, and it is a more powerful force than anything else we can muster. Attaching the proof of ownership to an economic incentive was guaranteeing its uptake. However, the responder fleshed it out when he said this:

> Something liked a government issued fiat currency may not have any obvious energy burden beyond its printing - but in fact, maintaining the value of a fiat currency requires a substantial investment in maintaining police enforcement, a legal system, and national defense. In comparison to the energy cost of hiring police officers to enforce economic honesty, the energy costs of investing CPU cycles in guaranteeing that honesty mathematically seems very small!

Of course it went to GPUs then ASICs, but those are actually way more *efficient* than CPUs at securing the blockchain. The hash-rate now makes it out of reach for any country to attack and forge. Russia, China and the US could all keep wealth secured in the blockchain, without fear of each other breaking it. However stolen keys could obviously be a problem, but then again keys are cheap and plentiful.

If you can understand that all production boils down to how much energy went in to producing it, including human labour, you will see that money is just an *analogy for energy*. Bitcoin is going straight to the end-point. The cost of the entire currency is baked in to electricity usage. Around the globe, there are millions of people working to secure their currencies against each other. The correct comparison is *not* hash-rate energy vs *banking* energy...but actually all the energy usage of people employed in securing and enforcing fiat currencies. To do a super rough back of napkin calculation, you can do something like this:

- Take the % of the spending on military, courts and the police force globally that could be reduced due to no longer securing a currency, and multiply it by the total global energy output. 

[The average global military spending is 2.2% of GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?end=2019&locations=US&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=1960&view=chart). The other ones are harder to estimate so let's just leave it out and just go by the military. [Global energy output is 39,292 TWh](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption). This means:

- Global military energy cost is (real back of envelope calc here) 2.2% of 39,292 TWh = 864 TWh

How much will be saved? No idea...maybe it would be none. How much effort actually goes in to securing a currency? Also no idea, but it's certainly a non-zero number. The point here is that the energy cost of securing BTC is in the right *ballpark* for global currency security. It's only wasteful because no countries are using it yet.",t3_ma3hdh,2021-03-22 09:35:33,2021-03-22

It's pointless and using these terms only makes you look dishonest (if not worse) to anybody who knows how things work.

Would make a more honest attempt, but fraught with its own perils. Batching also reduces that number as without batching each transaction would likely have a change output where a batches transaction typically combines those into one change.

> LN and layer two don't have anywhere near the onchain volume though, unless you can show me some evidence otherwise?

There's no way to know that and depending on what you mean by volume may also not be fair. The number of transactions on LN may well exceed on chain. But the number of BTC may be lower as LN is mostly intended for smaller amounts. Liquid may well also do a lot of transactions, I have no idea.

But that’s exactly what they did, it’s kind of the point of the article. Ofcourse, they’re going to build (or by now have built) additional infra to be able to sell the generated power for a better price than what miners are willing to pay.

The dynamics of bitcoin mining and electricity markets inevitably leads to the use of nearly free waste energy for bitcoin mining. 

Fierce competition between miners drives down the price of electricity at which mining is still profitable to near zero. Miners can’t pay as much as a regular customer such as a smelter so if the electricity can be transported to a higher paying customer then the miner will be outbid.

Electricity for grid use is too expensive to store, so waste energy is a given. Electricity prices can and do go negative on a regular basis if there’s both wind and sun in a region with solar and wind turbines. Bitcoin mining is about the only profitable application for this energy, and it can even enhance the business case of green energy projects. Who’d thought!
