Coinbase horror stories over the years make me not trust them anymore.  Even when I was in before, I transferred my coins away to a personal wallet I had setup on my phone, and moved them back when I wanted to sell.  Now I don't even want to use Coinbase, period.

The university management apparently agreed not to press charges if he disgorged the bitcoin (right, I'm sure he gave them all of it.) I wish I could remember the details.

Every four years or so, the block reward is halved. Until recently it was 12.5 BTC, and now is 6.25 BTC. This is so the total number of bitcoin eventually converges to a fixed value (21 million). Without a decrease in issuance, there would be no supply cap (a good thing or a bad thing depending on your school of thought).

The reason why investors get excited about the 4 year halving is because this creates a pressure on price: The incoming supply of new bitcoin has fallen but demand remains the same, therefore we could expect a price rally. This appears to be roughly true, as previous bullruns seem to coincide with halving events. Check out the bitcoin stock-to-flow model to see what I mean.",t3_ls0w9e,2021-02-25 16:54:39,2021-02-25

I believe in freedom of religion and freedom from religion equally. The issue I have with fundamentalists is they more often than not shove their views onto others who choose to be free from religion.

Your second statement is complete garbage so that's where I'll leave that.

I also don't hate Cathie Woods, so stop assuming how I think/feel about someone, that's fairly crass of you. I see believing in religion to a fundamentalist level in the modern era as being fairly narrow-minded and it usually acts as a red flag for me, given that I was raised in a fundamentalist Catholic family and was disowned for many years due to me rejecting religion.

I have been to prison and there's a long line of individuals who would choose 10, 20, 30 years of prison for that amount of cash.

&#x200B;

The worst part? It's possibly worth it.  


For the calculations comparing this to the average American income, you're doing it wrong.

&#x200B;

This should be compared against the average Mexican or third-world income.  
I know plenty of Mexicans who earn $1-3 an hour.  


At the high end of that, $3 an hour \* 60 hour work weeks, for 30 years.  
((3\*60) \* 52) \* 30 = $280,800  


This means 5 million for them represents what they would earn in 5,000,000 / ((3\*60) \* 52) = 530+ years.  


To put in the American perspective, if you assume 50K a year, for 530 years, that's over 26 million.  
That's not get out of prison and retire early.  
That's getting out of prison and living like a king in many parts of many first-world states.

2278,gon7v5z,t1_gomm8z0,"Hmm. So, let's see. Assuming a cubicle is a very nice prison, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks per year is 2080 hours per year, times 40 years is 83200 hours. Versus: 8766hrs in a year, so ~~11~~ 10 years of 24x7 is 87660 hours. 

The average income in the US is around $50k per year, times 40 years is $2 million. So, basically this is roughly equivalent to putting all your life's work hours in at once, except you don't have to do any actual work (in my country anyway), you get room and board paid for the whole time saving a shit ton of money you'd have spent on living expenses. You get to retire 30 years early, and end up making two and a half times more than the average person does in a lifetime of working 40 hours a week.

I mean, jail probably sucks and stuff, but still, like pretty much everyone gives away more of their life for less.

----

*Edit:* I've just realized I multiplied by 10 years, not 11. That'd be 96426 hours. So that's a big difference, but my point still stands. That's like 46 years of 40 hour weeks instead of 42, but I'd wager no one actually retires at 60 these days anyway, so yeah.

*Edit2:* And of course this isn't even counting the fact that in this hypothetical situation you'd end up with a lump sum at the end. Just sitting in a savings account with 1% interest would give you $50k per year forever. At that point even if you completely suck at investing you can live comfortably for the rest of your life without working or spending the principal 5mil.",t3_lrgrip,2021-02-25 07:57:31,2021-02-25

Do you people understand how long a decade is? Because sure, when I was crippled by depression I would have gladly given up 10 years for $5 million. 

But I refuse to believe any mentally healthy person would give up 10 years of their life being in prison for any sum of money. 10 years is so fucking long that you will probably be a completely different person when you get out. Everyone you knew would have moved on, and if they're still around they just want some money.
