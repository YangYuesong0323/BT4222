It's those of us that have been oppressed and bled by the same system and have been able to see Bitcoin as the potentially disruptive tech that drive this advancement forward... out of necessity or even desperation.

Yes, there are some rich visionaries that have joined our ranks, but they only provide some modicum of stability and validation, and if this experiment fails, they'll still have enough to land comfortably on their feet.

A $5 wrench attack with Bitcoin is essentially threatening someone with violence to procure their private keys. A $5 wrench attack with fiat etc would be threatening someone with violence to obtain their online banking passwords or forcing them to transfer fiat somewhere. It's just not something that really happens, at least in the developed world, because the reality of the $5 wrench attack is that it would involve kidnap and threat of torture. Outside of gang violence etc, your average citizen is safe from these sorts of crimes, because despite obvious and copious displays of wealth that many people make no effort to hide, the intricacies and complexities of these crimes versus the potential reward is far beyond the scope of most criminals, and the punishments severe.

The $5 wrench attack is more of a thought experiment than a realistic issue. It's basically saying that you can have an absolute shedload of security, but if someone is sufficiently determined, resourceful and lacks all basic morals or ethics, they can threaten violence and you'll give it all up.

You are right that it is rare but it seems to happen disproportionately to Bitcoin holders, it's not just a thought experiment. See https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42505261 or https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-trader-robbed-and-pushed-out-of-car-in-hong-kong as examples. Stealing fiat via a wire transfer is a lot more difficult to pull off because it's more traceable and can often be reversed in time before the money is gone. Plus, even wealthy people don't generally hold that much liquid fiat.

A ""bloke shopping in Pennsylvania wearing a B logo"" is indeed probably not enough of a signal  but openly bragging about owning large amounts of Bitcoin definitely increases your risk of becoming a victim if that information gets to the wrong person.",t3_ltzbn5,2021-02-28 20:51:55,2021-02-28

This makes zero sense as well. Just because you retain 90% of your Bitcoin doesn't make selling the 10% any more or less justified. It's either correct or incorrect. The only thing you're addressing is standard deviation (fluctuation). If you don't like swings, then yes DCA, and take profits... if you are wanting to act in the best interest of your long-term portfolio... buy as much as you can as early as you can, and never sell.

The amount you get is determined by the price.  There are fees involved but a good place can waive them.  I dont pay fees on anything.

I have spent 1k on my contracts and have made 2x my investment.  I got lucky as I had 25k in doge when it went nuts.

They just have that much more to lose and you can only park so much money into assets that are not tied to fiat in some way. Crypto is easily one of the best hedges against fiat and the smart rich people know this. They'll want to hold on to it as much as possible. Eventually some time in our future fiat dollars will be worth so little and crypto will (hopefully) be so integrated into society that we will no longer need to sell crypto for fiat to conduct everyday transactions.,t3_ltwoqv,2021-02-28 08:59:55,2021-02-28

Even after accounting for bear runs, the overall, zoomed-out returns are incredible. And sure, some of them are probably in it for a quick buck just like many newer retail investors were. But I have a feeling the majority of them are being told (and rightly so) that this new asset class called bitcoin should be considered a serious retirement vehicle in their portfolio. And why wouldn't they if you just look at the last 10 years alone?

Most of these people are already invested in funds that are designed to compound for 20-30 years or longer. So if they only have to wait 10 years for a couple more halving events to see BTC likely hit gold's marketcap? Psht. I'd be throwing my millions at it if I were one of them too.

Decriminalization usually leads to a release of prisoners and that, such as we've seen starting with states and decriminalization of cannabis, and prisoners impacted by those archaic laws. It's not a big chance, but it's a chance nonetheless that the government would potentially then allow the sites wallets back online again(although, still doubtful. They take money from drug seizures and pocket that shit) And if that were the case, people with their old keys *might* be able to pull the BTC into a blender a couple of times, and throw it out the other side to their own wallet. This is all theoretical, and really loose in terms of it actually happening, but it *could* potentially happen. Just really unlikely.

EDIT - Silk Road wallets were basically taken offline at the time of the SR seizure, which means no communication with the blockchain network.

4272,gp5tco2,t1_gp3t8uk,"The ""Bitcoin energy environmental impact"" claim is pure propaganda.

Recent studies conclude that a large amount of the energy used to mine Bitcoin actually comes from renewable sources, or from places where energy is cheap and abundant. This gives the miners the best return on their investment- so you could actually say that Bitcoin incentivizes the use and growth of renewable energy.

Next, arguments critical of Bitcoin energy usage always fail to account the exorbitant waste of the entire legacy financial system. For example, consider: 

-Harvesting cotton and other natural materials to make physical money (farming equipment, fertilizer, transport, gas)  

-Turning cotton into dollars with ink and other materials with toxic byproducts- which is then literally destroyed at its 'end of life'

-Paying guards, who drive to work every day (tires, oil, gas, emissions) to physically secure vaults of inanimate objects, with guns

-Paying employees to drive money transport trucks (lots of tires, oil, gas, emissions), to and from businesses, banks, etc. 

-The amount of physical bank locations worldwide, and the resources used to build and maintain them, including all the employees driving to work everyday (even more tires, oil, gas, emissions)

-The banking security systems and servers, and related security and cooling costs

-All credit cards, the plastic used to create them, and the entire credit card/credit infrastructure

-The energy involved in mailing bills and advertisements from other companies to card holders

-The amount of paper receipts generated by all financial activities

All of this, for a financial system that only operates from 8am-5pm, Monday through Friday.

Also, apart from the energy usage itself- in my opinion, the most egregious charge is referenced by a well known U.S. economist, Paul Krugman, who has openly admitted that the only reason the US Dollar has value, is ""because men with guns say it does""- a tacit admission that if you don't accept US Dollar imperial hegemony, the violence and destruction of the full weight of the United States Government will be unleashed on you (see: Muammar Gaddafi and his gold-backed Dinar, or current sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Russia, China, etc.). 

Being forced to use a currency under the threat of violence is morally and ethically reprehensible. 

Back to the energy usage, we're now under the understanding that this system of the US Dollar as the world's reserve currency, cannot be enforced without the United States military- the biggest pollutor on the planet.

Considering all this, it brings one to question the system of money itself, and those put in its charge- the Federal Reserve, a private bank, with minimal oversight by the US Government. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, the US Dollar has lost over 95% of its purchasing power, and through policy, it is solely responsible for economic boom/bust cycles that severely negatively impact the economically disadvantaged. 

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a community-run, open-source, decentralized protocol that allows for the instantaneous transfer of wealth, anywhere in the world, without the need for a middleman (banks, governments). The Bitcoin network is the most secure supercomputer in the world- it cannot be hacked, and it operates 24/7. It is unconfiscatable, deflationary, and uncensorable- allowing anyone to transact, and bypass illegal sanctions placed upon them by whichever government that might do so.

In my opinion, it is hard to deny that anyone refusing to accept the advantages of Bitcoin, while simultaneously defending the US Dollar system, is an imperial hegemony supporter, a genocide enabler.

Even if Bitcoin did use a larger amount of energy than the entire fiat legacy system, the simple fact that it does not require violence to function would make it the preferable alternative.
