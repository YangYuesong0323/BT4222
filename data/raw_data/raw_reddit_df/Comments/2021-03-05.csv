* 1) transfer electrum application via USB to your offline computer and create a wallet
* 2) save master key on USB stick
* 3) on your online computer use it to create watch-only wallet

To transfer out of your cold storage

* a) make an unsigned transaction on your online computer
* b) transfer unsigned transaction via USB stick to you offline computer
* c) sign the transaction
* d) transfer signed transaction via USB stick to online computer with watch-only wallet
* e) broadcast transaction

If you go this route i recommend going through this process with a small amount first, or maybe even electrum for EL TEE CEE or BE CASH (sry, need to trick censor bot).Also test to restore your wallet from your seed to be sure your backup works.

1. You need a nice stack of fiat in savings for emergencies. Enough money to cover all expenses for 3 months should do the trick. 
2. Start saving for down payment on a house. Real estate is a good investment. Buy a home. (hopefully you don't live in CA)
3. If your employer does any sort of contribution matching for your 401K, put as much towards that as you need to max out the employer match. If your employer doesn't offer any sort of retirement plan, meet with a financial advisor to start one up. I like Edward Jones.

2024,gpqrzj0,t1_gpqp83d,"I first bought a house out of school and rented out my spare bedrooms to friends. The house not only had utility by giving me a place to live, but it allowed me to essentially short the dollar by taking out a massive loan of 180k. As rent rose for my friends mine did not bc it's a fixed mortgage, now I'm renting it out at 2k a month and my payment is 1100 on a 15 year (tenants, I outgrew roomates).


I first learned about btc when it was $7 and bought in at $130, but I didnt buy much. Living well under my means (always had a free and clear reliable car, I wear clothes from costco, I dont take extravagant vacations) I just stacked sats for literally 7 years to this day. Given my low income out of school I could only buy $20 here and there, but that soon turned to $100, and now I buy around $2k a month. Trust me, those small buys you're making today feel like nothing but they are huge in the long run.

If I were to graduate right now, I'd do the same thing. First but a shitty house close to the city in a shitty neighborhood. Fix it up, everything you need to learn is on youtube. You'll learn valuable skills, save money, and increase the value of your asset. Rent out spare rooms while you're young. Eventually your neighborhood will improve (scary at first but if you're poor like I was you dont have much Choice, dont be house poor, ie over extended on your mortgage) and the house will skyrocket in value

With any excess capital you can muster buy btc.

I'd also recommend taking out a 0% credit card if you can qualify and roll that baby perpetually (I've rolled 10k for 6 years, I didnt buy btc on credit, I rolled my current debt to it which freed up capital) and buy as many sats as you can when you can. Pray for dips.

I only over extended myself once when I had to put new flooring in, and was forced to sell an entire btc at a disgusting 4500 in early 2019, sad. I try and keep as little cash in my bank account as possible. Even now with a baby on the way and a rental, making 6 figures, I keep only ~3k in my bank account. I know I can get a 0% credit card in case of emergency or worst case, I am forced to sell some btc.

I have never owned stocks. I have a 401k with company match that I max out, but since I am so overweight in btc I'm forced to hold the second worst asset besides cash, which are treasuries. That way I'm protected if shit hits the fan. I also own a small amount of gold and silver. I also shy away from stocks bc it feels rigged, from HFT to brokers front running your trades to the robbinhood fiasco.

Sure, yeah. Do you really think that governments can't confiscate Bitcoin? The fact that the US government has confiscated *hundreds of millions of USD* worth of BTC proves otherwise.

BTC is not insurance against government action. And in the event that there is government action against BTC, the value will drop so rapidly that it will be nearly worthless.

But honestly, I can see things going the other way - a time when companies and individuals are so invested in BTC that the governments start buying it to prop up the value if/when it starts to drop, just like they buy mortgages and other loans from the private sector.",t3_ly5vr5,2021-03-05 22:03:45,2021-03-05

We have seen over and over again oppression, denial of rights, restriction of freedoms which most expect and see as basic standards of decency.

Bitcoin will eventually become like gold. Scarce and finite. Yes valuable, but scarce and not many people will give two poops about it. It'll be scarce, expensive, and really hard to transact with. Gold weighs a lot - about 30lbs a brick and if you want to buy something with it, it's a real pain in the arse. While Bitcoin has no weight, it takes forever to transfer and has what ultimately would become unreasonable fees by comparison. So people would just sit on it.

Funny thing is that sitting on gold is actually safer than sitting on Bitcoin. Hackers will more easily be able to steal Bitcoin than thieves trying to steal gold from someplace like the Federal Reserve. Super neat vault, I've been and trust me - there's no way you're getting heavy arse bricks out of there before that door closes let alone getting up the elevator or stairs and out without being shot. Die Hard got it wrong. I'm sorry, I love Die Hard, but it won't work. It's not happening. But what is definitely likely is that someone would get hacked and have Bitcoin stolen...Again.

So no one is going to give a crap about Bitcoin except hoarders and the same people who buy gold. Fun side note: most the gold in the US Federal Reserve is not owned by the US. Yes, Bitcoin will be pushed off to people who think just because it's finite, it's valuable. While the rest of the world will run on unlimited printed money. Or in this case unlimited digital bits.

Except one person willing to fill the shoes of the Peter Schiff of crypto. You know, that crazy guy trying to get everyone to invest in Bitcoin. It'll be like the anti-Peter Schiff. They'll have cage matches and the winner of those cage matches will be awarded Doge coin. Who might this hero be? It might just be Elon Musk. Sounds very reasonable. Very reasonable indeed.

It is not because Bitcoin is appreciating in value that is why it will become the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce. The price appreciation is just the market recognizing over time that Bitcoin is a standalone system outside of the world of central banking and finance capable of final settlement without concern for borders, apolitical and neutral, permissionless and nearly frictionless, open for transactions 24/7/365 and with open markets every second of the day with a bid and an ask in practically every currency pair, free from government manipulation and debasement. (PS did you know that the stock market is open 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week, or 32.5 hours per week, ie - open only (7x24=168) 32.5/168, just under 20% of the time, not including holidays or circuit breaks. That means every year of Bitcoin trading is actually 5+ years of stock market trading) 

The problem with comparing Bitcoin to the massive list of companies/commodities/currencies that have shot way up before coming crashing back down is, how many of those experienced massive drawdowns, were left for dead, and then they rose again to even higher levels than ever thought possible before? Its crashed, and I mean CRASHED, about a dozen times with 80% or more drawdowns -- curiously though, always at higher lows. And here we are somehow, scraping $50k a coin, 900 Billion dollars worth of value created out of uhhh - a bit of ingenious code and a transparent ledger.

The question you must ask yourself is, why? Why does it not die? It has every reason to! No other example comes to mind of anything coming back from the dead once, let alone multiple times. 

&#x200B;

Bitcoin is a protocol layer on top of which the application layer rests. The only comparable example is TCP/IP - otherwise known as, the internet. The internet digitized and democratized information- it is now in the same power as you and I as someone with access to the world's best minds to find out whatever we want at the absolute cost of ZERO. Bitcoin is the digitization of money, it is the democratization of money. Today only the privileged in first world countries can have access to bank accounts, credit cards, checkbooks... To send a wire internationally you can pay $35 and wait a couple of days, that is if the country you are sending to is a country your country is down with and the amount of money does not raise any eyebrows in compliance departments.

But we are now in the process of seeing the transformation that will allow any person anywhere the ability to send money unfettered, without questions, without unreasonable fees, nearly instantaneously, from Istanbul to Venezuela if that is where their family members live, on a Saturday, at 11PM, and the person receiving it is not charged extortion fees, or bullied, or marked, or followed, or known to have received any value whatever. 

How much is something like that worth? 

&#x200B;

So in the end if price is all you see, there is a reason for it, it is the iceberg under the surface that you are not seeing, this irresistible, unstoppable force that has been released into the world without hope of curtailing it no matter how much those who control the money supply might try. 

And that is because Bitcoin, without firing a single round and without spilling a drop of blood, has forever placed beyond the reach of man the ability to manipulate and control the money. It is a voluntary system with clearly defined unchangeable rules (21M BTC, Nodes, Proof of Work, Difficulty adjustment, permissionless, non-sovereign, neutral, Supply schedule set in stone for the next hundreds of years) that if you would like to participate in, you are more than welcome to. If you decide you don't like it, you may sell it and leave. And without a CEO, marketing team, or coercion to transact in it as in FIAT, it has made people believe in it to the point of it being today one of the top 15 companies/ commodities/currencies with the highest of market caps, and it is the only one that looks bent on rising the ranks faster than any of the others. And for the first time in its history the macro external outlook has made it look by comparison, FOR THE FIRST TIME, as a desirable place to park value by those with value to park, accumulating enough liquidity to interest public companies. Validation for the thesis subtly embedded in the first block, ambitious and ridiculous in its scope and imagination, PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME, earning respect in the eyes of the most serious of capital allocators. 

And isn't it interesting that as the price appreciates, it actually becomes more useful and valuable, a better network, more reachable to bigger and bigger entities? It is the world's most fine-tuned positive feedback loop ever witnessed. Created by someone (anonymous of course, how else!) who understood this needed to be a public utility (as in water or electricity) and never cashed in on their deca-Billions! IS YOUR MIND BLOWN YET

Bitcoin is in the envious position of having time on its side. Everything else feels like it is borrowing against the future at ever-steepening costs to attempt to keep the charade going for another day. Short term gain, long term pain. Every decision at a corporate and government level today is made with the short term in mind, without paying a lick of mind to the long term. Bitcoin just mines another block. And another one. Miners keep dedicating to it more hashpower. It gets stronger and more secure. Monetary policy automatically tightens every 210,000 blocks/ approx every 4 years. Price rises. And the loop goes on. 

With this scenario as laid before you, in the long term, how does this all play out from here? 

Bitcoin in the end, is an unalienable right. Like water. Like electricity. Like the internet, arguably. 

because...  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And that includes freedom of monetary opression. For every human being on the planet, INDISCRIMINATELY, let freedom ring.

If you run bitcoin through the test, it passes the first one - it does have value today (it's trading on exchanges as we speak). The second test is a matter of opinion.

Additionally there are other factors at play: the majority of price action recently is a result of a company counterfeiting US dollars and then using them to buy Bitcoin from people who don't realize they're being paid with worthless money.  In the short term, this drives up the price as there is seemingly increased demand for an asset in limited supply.  

We are approaching what you could call a ""liquidity crisis"".  When cryptobros brag that we've hit a 1 trillion dollar market cap, they're trying to make you think that cryptocurrency has had 1 trillion dollars moved into it, but the truth is it's only a small fraction of that because market cap is an extremely deceiving statistic.  It's calculated by multiplying the coins in circulation by the current sell price, but the reality of the situation is that it's impossible to sell all the coins at that high price.

As soon as a sell-off starts to occur, the price declines.  As price declines, investors get skiddish and want to lock in their profits before they evaporate, so they start to withdraw real USD from the system.  This is when shit hits the fan.  The reality is the exchanges have quietly shifted to a fractional reserve system, which is to say they don't have enough money to pay out everyone should everyone try to withdraw.  Some will get desperate and sell even lower just to ensure that they get something out.  Imagine if you're climbing down a ladder carefully, but then 300 people start climbing down after you, a few of them fall, and all of a sudden everyone's in a pile on the ground with not much to show for it.",t3_lxiou4,2021-03-05 16:50:56,2021-03-05

I've seen comparison between Bitcoin mining energy usage and the entire financial industry. Could anyone put it on the context of how many people are served by the entire financial industry vs how many people use Bitcoin?

And what does the future hold - if we were to completely drop fiat currency, how many people in the financial industry would continue to work there, just counting, advising, trading and moving Bitcoin instead of fiat?

AND wouldnt the energy consumption exponentially go up as the price of BTC goes up because paying more for power becomes an acceptable compromise because the payout is the same in the end?

Given that mining is agnostic to the type of energy and geographical location, it is extremely competitive. Miners will naturally gravitate to the cheapest energy sources available. This tends to be surplus energy that cannot be stored or channeled into anything productive. 

Take wind turbines for example. These operate 24/7, but demand for their electricity falls during off-peak hours (night). By funneling the excess power into mining, one is able to generate additional revenue for the turbine. Same goes for other green sources with no real ""off"" switch like hydro and nuclear.

In other words, mining gravitates towards the cheapest electricity available, and obviously the cheapest energy is that which cannot be used for anything else (lack of demand).",t3_lxs9za,2021-03-05 23:00:05,2021-03-05

They are correct, even purported ""green energy"" has Environmental impact, like extracting the steel ore, melting and casting it, shipping it out to a windfarm and assembling it. All Environmental impacts. If it goes defunct and left abandoned on site, again Environmental impacts. They bring up bird strikes (apparently painting the blades a visible color to birds helps immensely). But when you dig a bit deeper, they criticize green energy, because their intelligent political opposition supports it and recognize it as a profoundly better technology for electricity production than fossil fuels. 

And so knee jerk reaction they hate green energy out of spite.

They do it out of spite. They want to watch the world burn, either by stupidity, malice or both. Often enough they're not intense environmentalists or neo-luddites. They're just intense partisans for their own extreme Anti-science/anti-environmentalism political agenda.

I think I'm warranted in saying it's hypocritical, as these media companies could be focusing on the environmental impact of fracking or that of coal or oil (if you wikipedia global energy consumption, you will see that about 65% of all energy usage is coal/oil) instead of bitcoin. Assuming bitcoin uses roughly 130 Terawatt hours of electric a year, this is about .1% of all energy consumption on the planet. You can look these figures up yourself if you doubt me. Also, in most places, bitcoin is at least partially mined with renewable energy, so this energy consumption isn't as bad for the planet (China is the exception but that's more of a China problem than a bitcoin problem). Here's an article that touches on that https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-energy-consumption-is-far-more-efficient-and-greener-than-todays-banking-system/

As for the finance industry, I've seen estimates of about 100-150 terawatt hours per year, but this probably only accounts for the power it takes to keep banks and atms functional. I won't pretend like I can tell you how much it is, but I would be willing to bet the amount when accounting for all variables it is many times higher. That being said, it's probably about as negligible as bitcoin's energy consumption.

In conclusion I think it's hypocritical because there is clearly an agenda at play. The media tries to scare people by saying bitcoin energy consumption is higher than that of Argentina's, but only accounts for electric and doesn't focus on the types of energy being used (aka renewables aren't nearly as problematic). When accounting for these, bitcoin's energy consumption has a relatively small  environmental impact. I'm sure that amount will increase unless there's a huge fundamental bitcoin change, but it will likely be built on new energy and therefore isn't as much of a climate concern.",t3_lxs9za,2021-03-05 07:31:46,2021-03-05

Maybe the guardian had good intentions but my main point is that Wall Street puts out a new article using the same scare rhetoric every day (Barron did today). The fact of the matter is it does have a negligible effect on the planet since more than 75% percent of bitcoin miners use renewable energy, and the amount of total energy used (.1%) is low enough where it wouldn't matter at all if we shifted from oil and coal. The carbon footprint is coming from those who plug into power sources illegally or are using coal.

I just read the Guardian article and stand by what I said about it being misleading to say bitcoin mining uses more electricity than an entire country and then not go into the statistics on how much energy being used is renewable. They make no comparisons to the carbon footprints of other institutions where it would make sense, such as with gold, except when it serves to make bitcoin look bad. They're willing to say where bitcoin goes wrong compared to gold and then aren't willing to talk about how much worse gold mining is because it's not built on renewables like bitcoin (I urge you to look at the article I linked above if you haven't already). 

It's just bad journalistic practice that doesn't contextualize the data that they use. Maybe it wasn't the author's intention, but it's still misleading nonetheless, and is why I'm inclined to believe that these people either don't understand bitcoin or have an alternative agenda.

Nothing the story writes is false. We could obviously wish for it to be contextualized better, as we could with so much, but every story has to end somewhere. It should be our responsibility to then challenge The Guardian's angle, perhaps in an opinion piece directly sent to them, explaining where that energy comes from.

There's no way you have time to become an expert on any given subject you're offered a story on while also being an expert at the journalistic practice and meeting your daily deadlines. 

Do I wish there was a newspaper that did not mind spending 2-3 months on a story before publishing it to get the context right and present it well? Sure I do, but these aren't the times.

Journalism is in the middle of an industrial crisis and year-over-year people end their subscriptions because ""I can get the news for free on the internet anyway,"" completely undermining the industry's ability to produce qualitative content. 

Even the free newspapers rely on the traditional media to provide the stories for them. They're effectively snubbing something another company paid money to produce and then acting like their hands are clean when said other company goes under because they see no return. 

So I don't think this journalist had any preconceived notion of how the article would end up, but they had to rely on their sources and the limited time they had to produce and publish, and that inevitably means some angles and context get cut.

But as private citizens we are at liberty to assume they're somewhat accurate. A serious journalistic outlet does not have the priviledge of assuming things. If they want to push the idea that bitcoin mining is 75% sustainable, they need to verify and investigate that claim critically before forwarding it. That will easily double the workload of the individual journalist who's already hard pressed to meet the deadline.

The issue is that quality journalism is a lot harder than just reading white papers and including as much information as possible. There are serious scientific reports out there claiming climate change is not affected by human activity. The journalists don't run with those reports because they take the time to independently verify them and fact check with other experts. If they were to run with the DB/MS reports they would have to do the same due dilligence there. 

That would be optimal, yes, admirable even. But it would require people to be willing to pay these newspapers enough to make a profit that could be reinvested into investigative journalism, and I just don't see that happening anno 2021.

Moving between wallets does NOT seem to require reporting, but when it's cashed out it would be reported, based on the capital gain/loss incurred when cashed out. Could one theoretically transfer to a different wallet at the ""current"" price, then cash out at the same price the coin was acquired (in that wallet) at, therefore not causing a capital gain or loss?

EDIT: Nevermind, I didn't look at the year in the OP. The guy said he bought DURING 2020. I believe it had already been known that that's not taxable, it's coin that has been held for over a year.

There was the idea that without work, without effort, without work you could get rich. Only buying tulip bulbs would you get rich. A minimum annual salary was 150 florins. People went into debt to buy tulip bulbs. A plague came, thousands of people died, including peasants who grew tulip bulbs. The bulb market was strangled by the reduction in supply to irrational figures. Short squeeze they call you now. From paying thousands of florins, one day nobody wanted to pay anything for the bulbs, and the holders of the bulbs were left with that. Bulbs that were worth nothing. I am not talking about Bitcoin.

Something that is irrelevant to my research but caught my attention was the short aqueeze that occurred with the tulip bulbs when, when a large part of the farmers died, there was a retraction of the supply of bulbs, which in turn produced a hyperbolic rise in their price.

However, people once did the separation of religions and states, they could do the separation of money and states again.

3656,gpq0y7n,t1_gppkci6,"I think both of you are wrong on some key aspects:  

1. There are so many forms of socialism that's this topic alone would exceed everything you can do on reddit. But the socialism as envisioned by Marx and Engels is a very ristrictive of the free market and by the entitlement of bureaucracy ends up in power structures that in the end become corrupt and halt growth by removing incentives for it. By the ideal that everyone is equal in every aspect and deserves the equal amount of goods/money/whatever you remove incentive to be better. That's just a fact. Charlie Munger once said: Show me the incentive and I tell you the outcome. In true socialism there is no incentive. Basta.
2. A *certain degree* of Socialism (but then it's not socialism, but merely social policies) can exist parallel to a free market. What Norway, Sweden and Canada have is a very liberal approach to economy. At the same time, they use the wealth that is generated by their free markets to use it in their *social policies* like paid maternity/paternity leave, safety nets for unemployment etc. That still doesn't make them Socialist. They are free markets with no restrictions to the amount of wealth you can generate. The proletariat doesn't own the means of production, etc etc. Wealth cannot be seized and personal freedoms are upheld to a high degree. 
3. Venezuela, just as Cuba, North Korea, the Sowjet Union and some African States, are what Socialism looks like. Power in these nations is never backed by the people but by ideals. They have so much power that they can just implement their stupid ideas on how to run the economy. But onyl the people know what goods and services they want because only the market can provide the mechanisms to determine where work and resources has to go to prosper. Not some con men who wiggle into their positions by being corrupt. Once there, they can change the constitution or whatever to maintain power. A truly socialist democracy would work in theory, but the fact that it never existed or ALWAYS divulged into dictatorships should be something that should get everyones gears working.",t3_lxos78,2021-03-05 09:17:38,2021-03-05
