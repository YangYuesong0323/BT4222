1695,gtxfqyu,t1_gtxc0eg,"By running your own full node, essentially A) You don't need to trust a third party that the rules of bitcoin are being upheld as you check the blocks yourself and B) You don't rely on a third party to broadcast your transactions (which may have some privacy and anti-censorship benefits).

I recently set up a node with a similar setup to OP. To be honest, the benefits of running a node probably don't offset the cost of equipment + bandwidth usage. It's more of a fun hobby project for me.",t3_mng6ar,2021-04-09 21:31:07,2021-04-09
1696,gtxmxi5,t1_gtxc0eg,"*TL;DR: benefits of privacy and no need to trust third parties with your balances/transactions/coins*

In order to know which transactions have happened on the network, a wallet needs to have a source for this knowledge. A full node is such a source. If you don't use your own node, you (your wallet) are using someone else's node, with all the implications for your privacy and trust assumptions.  

A full node is a software that verifies your bitcoin transactions for you (implicitly it also verifies the overall supply of bitcoin, protects you from fraud from third parties, from ""fake"" bitcoin etc) and gives you a higher level of privacy (you don't leak sensitive information to your wallet's nodes, f.ex).  

Here's a great explainer by P. Wuille (although it doesn't even mention the privacy benefits):  

> One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
>  
>    
> If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
>  
> * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for miners, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
> 
> * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
> 
> * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
> 
> * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
> 
> ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
>  
> If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
> 
> SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
>  
> Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
>  
> So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
>  
> Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
>  
> Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

Recently I quit my job. I have a 1 and 3 months old son and with the pandemic and my work putting my health and my families at risk I determined ‚Äòminimum wage‚Äô to not be worth the time I could be spending with my family and son. How could I do this! It‚Äôs irresponsible! I must work and provide for my family. 

Well I am. Since the bull run I made my yearly salary just by holding what I had. That means I could choose to walk away from an abusive employer and spend the time taking care of my son. Without bitcoin my employer would have my bills to hold against me and I‚Äôd forever be kicking myself for missing out on all the moments I‚Äôve had with my son and in the future. But since I have no debt, own our small apartment and own a modest some of bitcoin that timeline doesn‚Äôt have to happen.

Like I said after seeing 2 cycles, it is the emotional, short term, yoloing ""investors"" that put to much money that are constantly pumping price predictions trying to justify their entry. Its alarming these institutions are doing what new comers do back then. 

Maybe we aren't so different afterall.

 it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwill bitcoin go down substantially after I buy in‚Äù argument and the answer is also no if you assume continued growth of adoption: if the maximum potentiak of bitcoin is replacing all money, (valueofallmoney)/~21,000,000 is that maximum value.

Think of it not in terms of bitcoin, but if someone basically cloned bitcoin in a ‚Äúfork‚Äù without changing anything about it. It woukd fail for three reasons: 1 being the ‚Äúpost launch obscurity‚Äù equating to a premine 2 being what miner would use their rig to mine something worth waaaay less and 3 how easy it would be for anyone to attack it with sheer hashrate that is a nonthreat to the main chain

In terms of you buying your own Bitcoin like most people are doing, say you want to buy $100 worth right now.  

As I am writing this comment, one entire Bitcoin (which is divided to 8 decimal points, not 2 like a dollar.... meaning the smallest unit is .00000001 Bitcoin or as we like to call, a ""Satoshi"" or ""Sat"" after the anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto) costs $58,04x.xx  


Your $100 buys you roughly .00172286 Bitcoin or 172,286 Sats.  


If the price tomorrow drops to $54,000, your .00172286 Bitcoin that you still have will temporarily be worth only $93. You don't actually lose anything in this scenario until you chose to sell at a loss (which is absolutely the worst idea you can ever have when it comes to Bitcoin).

Saying ""I would guarantee the price at $100"" is all well and good, but unless you have $2,100,000,000 ($2.1 billion), you can't actually afford to pay $100 for every single Bitcoin.

It isn't a guarantee unless you can back it up, so the price could still drop below $100 once you ran out of cash to buy at $100, whereas OP would need $210k to truly guarantee Bitcoin at $0.01 which is more feasible

Of course, there are lots of people who would buy at lower price levels, so the price is basically not going to crash to $0.01 - but the point is that a guarantee requires on person to have sufficient assets to back it up",t3_mmr34j,2021-04-09 00:17:34,2021-04-09

Once the halving goes to zero, and no new coins get minted through mining.

>  Why would that be the point that Bitcoin stops being an investment?

Because right now bitcoin is suffering from rampant speculation, and people desperate to mine as much of the coins as possible. But every 4 years that incentive goes down, as you get less and less coins for your mining work.

Eventually the only incentive to mine will come from transaction fees themselves; which hopefully will drive off a lot of the miners and the speculators.

In the same way you don't *hodl* your cash, but instead use it to buy coffee and spicy chicken sandwiches. 

Bitcoin needs that.
