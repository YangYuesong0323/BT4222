126,gotew9u,t3_ls0w9e,"Why are people so nervous about dips? My experience is that happens when they put money they are not willing to lose. Let me tell my story; in 2017 I bought 2 BTC at around 15K. It went up to almost 20K and everyone said it would reach 100K etc. It did not happen, in fact went down to 6K and I bought 4BTC more. All I wanted was to recover the money I was losing by the initial purchase. I managed to lose 1 BTC at somepoint in 2019 by selling all and then FOMO buy everything again at a higher price. 

All this had been kind of a headache just because I was not prepared to lose that money. It gave me stress, anxiaty, etc. Now, last december the price reached 15K, was going up and then started to drop again and I thought, can't do this anymore, im out. Sold the 5 btc. Few hours later, if I wanted to be out, i would have lost 0.5 btc so I said no, it happened to me once so did not buy in again. Let the pride win. 

Now, if I wanted to buy again I would barely make 1BTC meaning I lost 4 of them. Worst is that I did not need the money for anything. Sold in a middle of COD Warzone match after seing an uphold notification saying that BTC is on the move down by 5% or something like that. 

So my advice is, if you trully believe, buy what you can afford. Don't let the pride take you. Don't share your decisions with friends, only to your wife/husb mom/dad, maybe siblings.

This is not for everyone. However, nothing stopping you to jump in or out. Just be sure you know what you want and you accept.",t3_ls0w9e,2021-02-26 18:52:04,2021-02-26

Until today, BTC was considered risk on just like stocks, and sold off with the market when money shifted to risk off.

Now, BTC did have a sell off over the last 4 days, but has held its range in spite of the market decline. 

So, the million BTC question is this: Has the  paradigm shifted and can now now truly consider BTC to be digital gold, a store of value and wealth preservation?

Stock to flow is around 34-35k. We've been overshooting by a mile due to tesla/gigachad Saylor and co. Would take something nuts to even sniff those levels.

F2pool still has a butt load of coins. They'll do this more 'cause it works, and while they come out with more overall assets they'll come out with less BTC each time. Years from now the Tower of ~~Terror~~ Dipper rides will end, but for now enjoy a lower entry point. Options expire tomorrow., until then the price will (probably) be heavily pushed down.

There’s only 21m of them in the world. In the earlier days it’s easy for people to miss the value these people bring. The temptation of fooling around and being all young and yolo, reminds me of the sweet temptation to just ‘sell at the top’ when the Bitcoin price looks kind of frothy, because it’s fine you can try to buy again later. The same way you can spin a few yarns and try to win back over your 10/10 partner. 

Except.... one day those 21 million incredible people will find other people, people who value them a lot more than you do ... and will never do anything stupid to let them go... you won’t ever get another chance

I HODL myself, not as many coins as I could have had because a couple of years ago I wasn't this wise, but - I feel absolutely zero need to cash out at it's current state.

BUT, remember things like diversification and your specific investing PLAN. When will you get in? How much? When will you get out? How much is enough gain? How much is enough loss? BTC, whether a “good” start or not, is providing many young investors with their first experience in the market.

The hard part about predicting prices in 2021 and beyond is that we've been saying for years institutional money is coming, and it's finally started to arrive.  I read somewhere recently that 6% of Bitcoin is held by institutions.  If that number seems low, think about how many more are coming, and how their arrival will affect the price.

If Bitcoin holds between 40 & 50K for the next couple of months I'll be thrilled thrilled thrilled!  I'll be buying with every dollar I can get my hands on.

I see so many people talking about taking profits, but most of them won't be able to get back in without buying at a loss when the price starts to rise.  I don't know how long we'll be under 58K (or current all time high), or even under 50K, but all it takes is one big story in the news to send the price skyward.  A lot of people sold in November when the price shot up to 19K and then dropped to 17.  They felt like geniuses, taking profits.  Cha-ching!  But then the price shot up to 20K. Then 25K, 30K.  It's funny, really.  People are freaking out because the price now dropped to 45K, but the ones who sold at 17K are wishing they were still in.

Keep your eye on the prize. The next halving is in 2024, then 2028, and 2032 (roughly speaking).  Each halving leads to a supply cut that leads to a run in the price as demand exceeds supply.

Realistically ever since 2020 BTC has become tied to SPX (S&P index, the overall market) and VIX (volatility of SPX) and volatility jumped like crazy today while SPX tanked so of course BTC tanked.

I've watched bitcoin since 2016, and always thought I was too late and didn't have much money to invest (or so I thought). Now that I bought at 30 and 50k, I will not sell for years. I'm not interested in taking profits short term, as I finally believe that bitcoin has a solid chance to be around for a long time. Institution money convinced me of that, so right now I will put all my savings in btc, and all the remainder of my salary, DCAing once a week, with the intent of leaving it there for years. I am aware of how volatile this market is and don't understand people who panic sell lower than they bought.

Worst case scenario, BTC crashes hard because of a failure in the protocol and I loose 1 year worth of savings.

Bitcoin hit new all time highs and people poured into the market for fear of missing out, the bitcoin market becomes too overheated due to over leveraged long trades and speculators. Someone sells a large amount of bitcoin to pull in profit, this causes the price to dip suddenly setting off a chain reaction of panic sells and automatic stop loss liquidations set on trading bots, the price dips down and retest prior support levels shaking out weak hands and speculators in the process, once the dip levels out the price consolidates for a period of time at a certain price range underneath the prior all time high, during this consolidation period, smart money like wallstreet investors and hodlers buy more bitcoin while weak hands continue to sell at an even rate holding the price in place.

It will fluctuate. A lot.  And it will hit rough patches every single time the government starts to toss us their newest threats (Yellen, Powell).  

You HODL.  You use these times to buy more.  EVERY SINGLE TIME, DCA gets rid of your fiat and gets you more precious satoshis. Feel bad that you bought at 56k? Buy more at 46k; your average cost is now lower than 56 and you have more. 

Like a lot has changed from a month ago. Not really... if anything, the thesis that inflation is rearing its ugly head is getting proven true and the stock market is panicking.  

Need inspiration?  Tesla buying bitcoin between 30 and 40K. Saylor buying another billion at 50k. Square getting another 175m at 50k.

Incorrect on both counts.

1. Blockchain is the technology, not Bitcoin.
2. Government can indeed place enough constraints on its usage to ensure it becomes as good as 'stopped' or never gains adoption.
