I was googling about a random billionaire and the concern of dollar depriciating is real. 

>Griffin’s concern now is the impact **rapid growth in monetary supply and massive deficits will have on not just the dollar, but fiat currencies generally.** Citadel held a sizable gold position in recent months for the first time in a while, he told Jones at the Robin Hood event. Griffin suggested investors focus on assets that perform in an inflationary scenario: precious metals, some energy products and real estate.

793,gpeqjp2,t3_lvx80u,"I remember reading an article, long ago, titled “The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin.” It detailed how the crypto had trudged along at a few dollars per coin, finally rising all the way up to $25 before crashing down to $9. People who bought at $25 lost money, poor souls.

Nowadays, the rise and fall comes in waves of thousands of dollars. Thousands. SMH. Five years from now, the waves might be in the tens of thousands.

You put in money you can afford to lose and that isn't even ""money"" for you. 1.000 Dollar? 5.000 Dollar? 10.000 Dollar? The number is different for everyone.  


At some point, the money you've invested becomes REAL money that you don't WANT to lose and THEN you start getting nervous. I don't give a shit about 2k becoming 200 or 4 k becoming 400 but I DO give a shit about 50 k becoming 10 k, because 40k make a difference in my life.  


Do hold through that Gatekeeper-Moment and accept that you don't actually have money put a ""potential"" for money, that is where I failed every time when it went up.  


And if I don't fail there, I'll fail at a 100 k level. If I put in 1k and it became 100k, then I have a VERY hard time just letting it sit there and become 50k again.

>The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a study on delayed gratification in 1972 led by psychologist Walter Mischel, a professor at Stanford University.[1] In this study, a child was offered a choice between one small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time. During this time, the researcher left the room for about 15 minutes and then returned. The reward was either a marshmallow or pretzel stick, depending on the child's preference. In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores,[2] educational attainment,[3] body mass index (BMI),[4] and other life measures.[5] A replication attempt with a sample from a more diverse population, over 10 times larger than the original study, showed only half the effect of the original study. The replication suggested that economic background, rather than willpower, explained the other half.[6][7]",t3_lvsk87,2021-03-02 11:41:11,2021-03-02

> So no, $10k bitcoins are not coming next year, and if they do you should seriously consider selling into that bubble.

> It's much more likely we get a sharp bubble that is kicked off by a wave of publicity in the spring, and we will see the price rise to new highs ($1500 to $2000) before collapsing back to sub-$1000 in the fall, and then steadily (Or quickly) climbing back up towards $2000 as the year winds to a close. We have never ended a year with bitcoin at its true price though. Most years it was below value, but 2013's black Swan bubble made bitcoin soar to unsustainable prices that were way above its true value.

> So we either end 2015 with bitcoin at around $1300 (in which case we are gearing up for the next bubble) or at $4000 (with a nasty shock in for the beginning of 2016).

> We reach $10,000 sometime around 2018.

> We reach $1 million dollars sometime around 2026.

2887,gpdmono,t3_lvs6xa,"## Bitcoin Compared to Gold

Gold is expensive to store securely.

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold is heavy, it takes up space.

You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold. You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

## + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be sent across the Internet.

Nobody spends gold as money these days.

People have been using Bitcoin as money, and as a store of value.",t3_lvs6xa,2021-03-02 11:46:46,2021-03-02

Bitcoin is like digital gold in many ways. Like gold, bitcoin cannot simply be created arbitrarily; it requires work to ""extract.""  However - due to its source code—it must have a limited and finite supply. For this reason, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins ever produced.

I think this user meant to say that neither gold nor bitcoin yield dividends - but because the inflation in the gold supply is ~2% per year, while bitcoin’s inflation approaches 0%, bitcoin effectively has perfect inflation protection, even if adoption stays constant.

The USD money supply is increased ~6% per year, to achieve 2% “CPI” inflation, the other 4% is deflationary forces of innovation which drives prices down, so the money supply would need to be increased above and beyond that if you were a sick central banker hellbent on devaluing your currency in the name of inflation.

If bitcoin was hypothetically the global reserve currency with 100% adoption it would yield 6% annually compared to the USD. The reason returns are so much higher now is there is still network growth & adoption happening.",t3_lvs6xa,2021-03-02 18:59:48,2021-03-02

I also knew a correction was due, and it did happen, so I made money and didn't lose gains. I don't ever regret anything, but I do wish I had caught that 43k dip the other day. I'd buy back there, but oh well. I also dropped 1k of my investing money into GME and that's played out well so far.
