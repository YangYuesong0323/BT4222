459,gse4uue,t3_me78rb,"Question to a bitcoin investor

Bonds have coupons. Land has rents. Company stock has earnings growth and dividends. These things generate cashflow.

In the long run, commodities like gold, oil, and frozen concentrated orange juice track inflation. Commodities are highly volatile and speculative. They have no cash flow.

Fiat currencies are units of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. They’re inflationary, and their speculation is largely tied to their governments and economies.

What is the fundamental analysis that convinces an investor of a fair price for btc? What’s the argument for whether it’s under or overvalued? How is bitcoin not merely a speculative, deflationary asset? Why is there an expectation that bitcoin will provide a return on investment, aside from greater fool theory?

I’ll grant that blockchain technologies will see uses going forward, that some companies who create crypto networks and payment systems will succeed, that btc has seen greater adoption, and that bitcoin is useful as an alternative currency.

Even after I grant all of this,

Why is that an argument to own a btc token? Why not just invest in the companies involved? How is buying bitcoin more enticing than gold coins or Japanese Yen?

Stock investors look at high valuations and low earnings and can expect capital losses.

Bond investors look at expectations of inflation and interest rates and can expect capital losses.

What would convince you that the price of btc must have a “correction”?",t3_me78rb,2021-03-27 14:13:16,2021-03-27

645,gse8gyn,t1_gse4uue,"Fiat is a terrible store of value.  In fact fiat is designed to lose value over time.  Saylor calls it a melting ice cube.

The value of BTC is whatever the market says it is.  It’s intrinsic value, however, derives from its limited supply, the every four year halving events which predictably cut the availability of coins.  This halving schedule is in the code. This fixed supply is its utility. no one can fuck with it.  It doesn’t need to generate cash flow for it to have intrinsic value because of its one-of-a-kind utility.  BTC will not only increase your wealth but will preserve your wealth.

The Chinese yuan is manipulated all the time to support their national export strategy.  Importers have better purchasing power when the yen is weak and so China can undercut other countries in world trade.  Gold may be scarce but it’s supply isn’t even known, and it becomes less and less scarce with technological advancement.  BTC supply, in contrast, is known and fixed and deflationary.

Bitcoin just happens to be the biggest, and I suppose that makes it technically “speculative”, but the world advances through “speculative innovation”.  In a way, pretty much everything is speculative, even tangible commodities, and value is simply what someone is willing to pay for something.  Truthfully, I’m unsure exactly where Bitcoin will go or how values will be determined, but to me, I feel that the groundwork for that is currently being worked on right now.  Additionally, like you mentioned, blockchain tech is being considered for so many different things, so I actually sell options on blockchain companies that both benefit from mining bitcoin and improvements/adoption of blockchain in general.

At the end of the day though, I’ve noticed that with any type of investing, for every person saying that “x is a bad thing to invest in because of y”, there’s another that says the opposite, and in the end only one is right.  In general I believe in tech is the primary thing that drives change across the market, so I’m willing to invest in that concept.",t3_me78rb,2021-03-27 14:27:52,2021-03-27

Gold, although there is some amount of scarcity, we don't really know how much is available, and as technology advances, more can potentially be mined.

Whereas bitcoin we know 100% how much is available and it's schedule. Simple supply and demand economics. Aside from scarcity, you have ease of transportation, open source transparency, enhanced security, plus the overwhelming amount of innovation leading to productivity and growth lends to its overall appeal.

With very few exceptions, the only constant is that big money moves the markets when they decide to, so at anytime you can see either a big increase or a big decrease.  Paying attention to upward or downward trends is more of a day trading thing and seems just as accurate as listening to financial “experts” that literally change their opinions on things every week.  When Bitcoin is going up, something like Bitcoinist will post positive articles about how bitcoin is going to the moon, then 1 day later when bitcoin goes down say that it’s the “end of the bull run” and to watch out for the crash.  This is not unique to them either.

I would also like to mention that during the last instance where bitcoin hit its new high (58k), it immediately dropped to 47k and stayed there for a week or two before going back up.  It then hit a new high of 61k, then dropped down to 52kish.  Whose to say that this isn’t indicative of an upward trend?

Check your iCloud connected devices and see if there are any devices you don’t recognise associated to your account. Connected devices would have access to your photo library if you’re using iCloud Photo Library and/or Photo Stream.

If you’re not using 2fa an attacker could gain access to your account through the online iCloud page, they could theoretically access your photos from there with just your username & password.

You could also try and speak to Apple support and try to find out if any devices have been connected to your account around Feb 24th, in case someone was and later removed their device from the account.

The BTC and ETH they stole are traceable to federal authorities for the most part. Things get more difficult if they use tumblers, but can still be followed around.

If the police can't help you, the FBI can or another agency dealing with cybercrimes task force teams.

Preserve your phone as-is; DON'T wipe it or factory reset it; switch to using a prepaid Android and don't use the Apple phone text messaging or calls to people (manually copy the numbers to the android phone and text them from there) to make sure you don't tip off the attacker who might be able to see or send text messages from the Apple or record calls fo or from the device.

2024,gsfl9oc,t3_me2c4i,"Best way to prevent this is to completely root out any possibilities of compromising security.

Write down your seed phrase privately, no microphones or cameras nearby. Lock that up and and never take it out till you need it (after verifying that it's right) and don't let anyone know that you have a seed phrase or where it is. Seriously. Do **NOT** let anything tech-related even know of its existence and **only** ever type it into your Ledger that you got from the official LEdger website that is 100% genuine. Always double check genuine software too.

Next thing is not putting all your eggs in one basket. **Security is only as strong as it's weakest point**, which was your seed phrase. I like to think of a hardware wallet as a house kind of. You have the latest security alarms, best lock, constant surveillance and your door is completely explosive proof even. This is like SHA-256. Do you know what the robber does? He kicks in your windows and takes all your money.  The windows are like the one flaw, which is also the strongest element, which is the seed phrase. **No matter how secure it is**, lose your seed phrase and say goodbye to your crypto.

""Be your own bank, not your keys not your crypto"" yada yada, **lose your keys not your crypto either**. You might not like it but leaving it on something like Celsius or a trusted exchange like Coinbase **might** actually be safer, provided you use a strong password and 2FA, preferably with a security key for big amounts.

If you spread your crypto out on let's say, two hardware wallets, an exchange possibly or an earning platform or two and keep security tight, it's **very hard to lose more than half at once**.

I especially like Celsius's HODL mode, I hope this gets implemented in more places. In the case that your account gets breached; there is a 24 hour period where **nothing** can be withdrawn. You'll be able to lock up your account and move your crypto off to a hardware wallet and the hacker won't be able to do anything.

This must really suck, 40K is life-changing. But this is why you must take security so seriously and not being ""pretty sure"". You must be certain.

It is my understanding that icloud backs up your data even if you haven't set it up.

Your user name is your email, which I believe is no different than your itunes email.

Your password is also the same. So getting into icloud is fairly easy, and if course it includes your photos and screen shots.

When I search for email cracks for my own email I can see that like most people my email has been compromised many times.

So if you have an old yahoo email address that you use for your itunes, it is pretty much similar to giving up the keys to your crypto.

Now another thing is your computer. Windows defender is so good that hackers are actually developing for mac.

Because you only need to approve an app once. So if anyone uses your computer and puts a keylogger, it is really no different than your iphone.

Because Mac's use apps, whereas windows mostly uses a browser. So if your facebook password is the same as your itunes password, that could be a problem.

We are now working on sim card switches to see how easy we can capture google authenticator codes, and I haven't seen the results, but I understand they were surprised at the ease of being able to clone.

If you google ""remote keyloggers how to clone an iphone"". You can watch them clone an iphone without having physical access to it.

And in their latest test they cloned an iphone to a windows 10 emulator on a desktop pc.

Iphone is just weird, they go so over the top in some areas and others they just ignore.

load your main coins into the wallet with your extra passphrase.

load a little coinage onto the wallet without exra passphrase.

if your 24 seed words get stolen/copied, your dummy coins get stolen and you have enough time to secure your true coins to another wallet.

2-you did not update your firmware and someone managed to get into your house and forced the seed of your wallet , since there is an exploit that can get the seed without any pins due to dual cpu flaw .(it was fixed thru firmware).

3- you fucked up and wont say so !! but i kinda dont think so since you are a python programmer . so little tech savvy , you use alt account for crypto on reddit ...

\- what systems you've used to access wallets (phone, comp)

\- are you updating your phone, comp

\- do you have a high entropy wifi password, is it updated, do you have upnp disabled, generally... have you hardened your router

\- have you ever accessed wallet software on a public network

The price at the time of HALVING is ALWAYS the new floor look it up... so that being said 50k is extremely attractive for this bull market. People can afford to lose 5 to 1 with the chances of doubling up by summer to 100k.. now I think it will hit 100k by December. So with 10k being the floor off 50k for years it just doesn’t add up, that 10k is too high to be a floor, once people realize that it will be enough to propel it back to 50k atleast. This is a thing that will get stuck trading in a channel 50-100k then huge gap up and will be trading 100-200k at the next halving, everyone knows it and it’s computable in the numbers and algorithm.

I feel the same way.

HW wallets are not memory sticks that store your keys- they are calculators. The seedwords are used as part of an on-the-spot math calculation for the keypairs for *all* your accounts. Basically [seedwords] + [BTC acct 1] = keypair for BTC acct 1.

That key is used to 'sign' transactions (prove to the internet you own the key, but without ever revealing what the key is). The keys never leave your hardware wallet, and in a way, don't even exist except during the moments you're authorizing transactions for those accounts.

You could smash your hardware wallet, or leave it in a parking lot (that data is encrypted), and as long as you know your seedwords, you can plug them into a new HW wallet (even by a different maker) and recover all your accounts since the exact same [seedwords] + [BTC account #] = keypairs will be generated every time with a given set of seedwords.

Any password anyone could think of leads to a usable set of accounts, so people trying random passwords to see if you have any 'secret' accounts is not really viable. 

That way if someone steals your seed words, they still don't have access to your ""real"" accounts.

HW wallets like Ledgers are not ""key memory sticks"" that can be stolen from - they're calculators centered around a set of 24 seedwords.

When you want to access an account, like BTC 1, it on-the-spot calculates [seedwords] + [BTC 1] = keypair

That keypair is then used to sign a transaction. The key *never* leaves you wallet, and one one ever gets to see what the key is - all they can do is prove that the wallet knows what the key is.

The seedwords are kept encrypted on the ledger, and that data is useless without your PIN number to decrypt. The ledger will wipe itself on 3 failed PIN attempts... but entering your seedwords into *any* HW wallet will give you access to your exact same [seedwords + BTC 1] = keypair accounts as before, so it's not a problem if your ledger is lost or destroyed as long as you know your seedwords.",t3_me2c4i,2021-03-27 09:43:33,2021-03-27

More details: Unlike earlier laptops and desktop computers, mobile devices were designed to be compromised by manufacturers thinking it would only be done by ""trusted"" government agencies, but that is never the case. It is always done ny the underground and experienced individual gone rogue, too.

Since the early 2000's, chip manufacturers for desktops and laptops have gone that direction, too (look up minux and ring 0 exploits; soc with a network stack, os, and access to your data running off the chip under your OS that you'd never know is there and your OS above it even on baremetal could never see). But even still, there are more ways to keep a traditional laptop or desktop protected.

Today's phones are actually designed to gain user trust and be exploited. Some have compromises built in to the kernel, while others are compromised at the hardware or cpu level itself (i.e: snapdragon).

You're still a lot safer (usually) on a PC than ANY mobile device or tablet.

Mobile devices are for consumer convenience and easier spying and data collection from the outside, and to go more places to do that for them than even a laptop or netbook since it usually  stays on, running, and in your pocket or near by to you.

If you must use a mobile device, try to make it a single task per each mobile device you have, making it harder for an attacker when they can only get to one app or service at a time per device that you have over a network.

Keep as few important things on your phone or mobile devices as possible.

Offload important things to a flash drive instead and do more important things on the PC that can be turned off as soon as you're done.

This helps mitigate attacks and opportunities from the outside.

But no, mobile devices cannot normally be user-hardened because of their nature and design. Very rarely, and not easily when possible.",t3_me2c4i,2021-03-27 09:53:35,2021-03-27

B) saving a digital copy of their seedwords that a hacker steals, or having the seedwords copied by someone malicious IRL (both of these are more of an issue if you don't have a 25th word to protect your accounts).

Can you give some context to your daily routine?  Has anything irregular happened recently, like new cable installed, or a plumber to fix some pipes?  Anything out of the ordinary routine where someone may have been inside and realized you are a target seeing ledger box or something?  

The different attack vectors are less perplexing once someone knows you have crypto of any kind, because where there’s some there’s more.

2446,gsdryvy,t1_gsdo3st,"To clarify, there's a

* seed
* 25th word (passphrase)
* PIN

The seed is used as part of a math equation to figure out your account keys as you need them. Your HW wallet isn't a memory stick to hold keys- it's a calculator that stores a seed (encrypted by your PIN) that it uses for calculating your private keys on-demand. 

For example, your bitcoin 1 account for that seed will always be calculated by [seed] + [BTC 1] = keypair

If you add a passphrase to your account, the keys for those 'passphrase' accounts will now be calculated by the formula [seed + passphrase] + [BTC 1] = keypair

If someone steals your seed in this case, your funds are still safe, because literally any passphrase they could think to try will result in valid accounts they'd have to check for funds. There's also no way to prove if any (or multiple) 25th word accounts are tied to any given seen.

The PIN is simply used to encrypt the seed in memory so it can't be used by anyone without unlocking the Ledger first.

When you setup a 25th word account, you'll be asked to enter a 2nd PIN. This will be used to encrypt the seed+passphrase data for later use. 

From then on, the original PIN will decrypt the [seed] accounts, and the new PIN will decrypt the [seed+passphrase] accounts.",t3_me2c4i,2021-03-27 12:11:16,2021-03-27

2517,gsdhtnf,t1_gsdekfi,"You're welcome. Anyone who thinks a mobile system isn't designed for compromise compared to a PC or laptop has it 100% backwards.

Windows 10 is outright spyware, but using a linux or BSD system (or even Apple's OS X which was once based on a bsd kernel) is far safer than anything mobile.

Apple is exploited still, even though they harden their app store more than Android and Google Play store by default. They're all accessible.

Leaving your digital footprint everywhere with a mobile device is very hard to fix after the fact. You'd kinda have to take a step back, write down with a pen and paper what you need and what you don't on the phone, make a list of services you use and whether they can be run over a browser on the PC or a phone, and change your password for things one at a time to gradually invalidate any old footprint data on the device that could be scavenged and used to log in with.

Start with your email password, since any device that has access to that can get a link to reset passwords with existing services.

2FA one-time spoofs are still possible but not probable. Using email with an updated password that is not logged on to from a mobile device is safer than changing passwords for services but leaving your email accessible still through an app or password cache file on a mobile device if an attacker knows where to look or installs malware to do it for them.

This is usually a complicated and long process for everyday users, since they've been conditioned to do the opposite of this, consolidate their footprint, and throw their security to the wind.

I could spend hours typing what to do, how to do it per app, per situation, per device...but in short, just don't trust mobile devices, windows 10, or anything cloud-based or with a middle man if you can help it.

Instead, use linux, use a vpn, familiarize yourself with Tor, get familiar with virtual machines, research Tails and other LiveCD or LiveUSB OSes that load to ram only, diversify system dependencies, and keep the most important things - crypto and passwords to everything - offline without ""screenshots"" or compromisable photos of anything. Don't ever say a password over a phone call either these days or text it, because anyone on the other end or a bad app on either side can potentially record enough of the call to save an mp3 of what a verbally conveyed password is and send it to the attacker.

Your old PIN will continue to open your original seedword accounts, your new PIN will unlock you seedword+25th word-protected accounts. That said, I'd probably generate a new seedphrase, because clearly your old one was compromised (which is how they got into multiple accounts secured by the same HW wallet).

One plus side is that a 25th word *will* protect you even in the event of a compromised seed, as long as you never write down the 25th word anywhere. Just keep it as something simple in your brain, and enter it once into whatever HW wallet you're taking control of.

I just legit cannot imagine a scenario in which someone would be able to steal from multiple wallets secured in different ways in a short window of time like this unless they had a central place to pull info from (like physical access to your house, or digital copies of your seed and/or access to your computer, maybe via a RAT (remote access tool) or something?. 

If you're 100% certain you've never typed the Ledger seed in anywhere, and no digital pictures were taken of it, there's not that many options for how it could have been stolen... and it seems pretty clear someone has your specific current seedphrase for your ledger, and maybe for your trust wallet (or maybe they just got control of your phone while it was unlocked, or something like that, I'm less directly familiar with trustwallet, but I assume the keys are encrypted when the wallet isn't open/unlocked).",t3_me2c4i,2021-03-27 11:51:05,2021-03-27

They give some best practices towards the bottom of the Ledger article about it here

https://www.ledger.com/academy/passphrase-an-advanced-security-feature

Generally, it's recommended not to have it ultra short, but I also believe it's better to have relatively simple password you feel you can remember well without worrying you're going to screw it up.

While it's theoretically possible to brute force a 25th word on a stolen seed by trying literally every single possible passphrase, then generating accounts for each currency, then checking if those accounts are funded, then repeating the process for the new possible passphrase, I don't think it's a realistic attack method for all but the highest value of targets, and it'd just be a huge waste of time and money in 99.9% of cases.",t3_me2c4i,2021-03-27 15:35:04,2021-03-27

I'd still recommend making sure you split your funds among a few different well-trusted services/locations, and *maybe* also get yourself a HW wallet to keep another slice in, so you don't need to worry about losing everything at once if something crazy unexpected happens.

The nice thing about a hardware wallet is that it's really just a fancy shell for encrypting your seed words until they're needed. You could drop your hardware wallet in a gas station parking lot, ignore it without a second thought, fly to another country, pickup a new wallet, enter your seed, and bam- you've got access to all accounts protected by that seed back in your control.

Services like BlockFi, Nexo, and Celsius have been kinda life changing IMO (taking out tax free cash against my on-paper gains I used to invest in my home business has done so much for me this year), and *very* worth the relatively small risk of letting them manage a portion of your coin.",t3_me2c4i,2021-03-27 16:07:06,2021-03-27

One question I have though that's been confusing me as I learn. I hear people often say that mining, ""solves a mathematical equation"" like you did. I used to think this then spoke with some people much smarter than me and they explained it as computers ""guessing data to come up with a hash, so more like solving a puzzle through guesses."" 

Which is it? Because while similar, these are two different things. Solving a problem means problem->solution. Guessing a puzzle is guess solution->correct!

also mining isn’t “solving a math problem”

2643,gse6oh4,t1_gsdvbxg,"it’s not solving a mathematical problem, it’s also not guessing.

say the last solved block’s hash is this 0001234

this implies that there are three leading zeros in the hash which is the difficulty

now you have transactions 5678 and 9abc as well as another transaction that gives you the btc reward for successfully “mining” call it YUMYUM

the block then looks like this

0001234-5678-9abc-YUMYUM—

so now you try to create a hash of this block so that there are three leading zeroes

with md5 hash (btc uses sha256) and nonce=1

> echo “0001234-5678-9abc-YUMYUM--1"" | md5sum 
8b9b994dcf57f8f90194d82e234b72ac

nope

now try nonce = 2

it’s both solving an equation “what nonce gives a hash with curr_difficulty leading zeroes” and guessing since the nonce is arbitrary",t3_me4w6w,2021-03-27 14:30:57,2021-03-27

I saw that find a solution to the equation SHA256(SHA256(Some data + Nonce)) < Target  is solving a math problem. How they do it is by guessing different values to see if it works - for lack of a better way.

I would say all mathematical equations can be in theory solved either by guessing until you find a solution or coming up with a methodology.

2824,gsdnxfy,t3_mduoq3,"So I have to say.... everyone who believes BTC will “historically crash 80-90%” like it always does... I have done the math and from its halving day at 8800 it has gone straight up... yes to 50-60 k but that means when it drops it can only hit 8-10k since that will be it’s new floor. The price at the time of HALVING is ALWAYS the new floor look it up... so that being said 50k is extremely attractive for this bull market. People can afford to lose 5 to 1 with the chances of doubling up by summer to 100k.. now I think it will hit 100k by December. So with 10k being the floor off 50k for years it just doesn’t add up, that 10k is too high to be a floor, once people realize that it will be enough to propel it back to 50k atleast. This is a thing that will get stuck trading in a channel 50-100k then huge gap up and will be trading 100-200k at the next halving, everyone knows it and it’s computable in the numbers and algorithm. DO NOT LET THEM TRICK U to thinking this will all go to absolute 0. There’s no way that is even possible at this point.
