50,gqgishf,t1_gqgbbh3,"It depends on what you mean by ""blocking factor"". There are definitely parts of V2 which can be fully implemented without touching Bitcoin Core at all. But some of the features are very strongly overlapping with what Bitcoin Core already does. Of course, you can re-implement and extend in your code, but I claim it would be much more work and it would be substantially more risky. We understood it the same way when we discussed this before (with Jan and Matt). Two such features I remember from top of my head:

1) Transaction selection for ""second next"" block. It is a non-trivial task. And it is basically a more intelligent getblocktemplate with added information about the transaction set(s) from the ""first next"" block(s).

For better context. When ""the first next"" block is found somebody has to immediately calculate if the ""second next"" template (distributed to miners already) is still valid or not = if it can be used for mining immediately. But because the found block can be from external source and can contain any transactions, it is a non-trivial task. Bitcoin Core must do a lot of this processing anyway so by giving it the knowledge of the ""second next"" template, it can be processed very fast, internally. The point is that you have to be really fast in such moment to produce valid work for miners, because any latency here is a direct loss in mining time. This delay is the main reason why the whole ""empty block mining"" still exists - empty block always fulfill all TX rules so they can be sent to miners very fast. So.. To replace this, we must be very fast and follow ALL consensus rules for the next block template. A natural fit for Bitcoin Core with all the internal infrastructure. 

2) Checking proposed blocks. To allow miners to choose their blocks, the pool has to able to efficiently detect if a proposed block would be valid or not. Again, this forces the implementation to correctly follow ALL consensus rules. Re-implementing this outside of already existing properly functioning code base is IMO a madness. Bitcoin miners pretty universally trust Bitcoin Core for production. It is understandable. You as a miner really don't want to produce blocks not accepted by other nodes. So in the V2 context, you want Bitcoin Core to have the last word about ""can this proposed block be the next valid block""? Again, leading to a need to modify the software to allow these use cases instead of new independent code.",t3_m16uon,2021-03-11 00:07:28,2021-03-11
51,gqh3ihr,t1_gqgishf,"I appreciate the hard work and thought put into making v2 a reality. It is imo very important, that's what's driving my query. 

I fully agree with all your points and logic. 

This greatly mimics the same type of conversation I've seen in companies every day. There's the cleanest ""right"" way to do it, and we all know that's what you're describing .. and there's a fast way, but it's suboptimal. If it were me in this situation, I always try to find a way to do it fast with a path to optimal. It seems that's what has happened with the other v2 features, too. If core is changing fast, it's kind of moot to worry about. I just associate a massive risk with any change to that piece, so I worry greatly about the delay. 

Data point: I'm a miner and was a scrappy pool operator in like 11-13. Fwiw I care enough about this functionality that I'd happily run a forked version of core specific to v2 mining, or core + some other external shim daemon (largely core code base forked by a different name as to not reimpl, I'm sure). Most miners I know (20mW+) are all concerned about the ""China problem"" and I believe they'd be fine with it too.


My two sats.",t3_m16uon,2021-03-11 02:15:35,2021-03-11
52,gqhzgq4,t1_gqh3ihr,"I get your point and I think it is a great one in most circumstances! I have two more comments.

The nature of today's bitcoin mining is that the margins are very thin for most of pool operators. A very small, subtle problem in the consensus work can lead to severe economical hit (and hard to debug issue). And performance issues in the job distribution would lead to immediate and measurable loss too. So you would have to have a very strong incentive to run such code and be very much sure it cannot be wrong. The other option (the default and safe one) would be just not running it at all. If we ever want adoption by larger operations, it must be done ""right"". MVP on the correctness side is not enough. In my estimate, of course. (Interesting perspective to see: If the mechanism would have e.g. 1% change of making a mistake, a miner would loose 1% of rewards on average. You can easily decide to risk it! From a pool perspective, 1% can very well be all your money what you make or very close to. The risk is absolutely disproportional. 

The second point is that even if you would be ok with some MVP, the best approach would still be a patch for Bitcoin Core. It seems like the most straightforward solution and the least work. So anybody capable of doing it would be great. Even in some very basic MVP version of the code.",t3_m16uon,2021-03-11 06:00:03,2021-03-11
53,gqi1zoa,t1_gqhzgq4,"Interesting. So the concern is about adoption from pool operators rather than miners?

I may be naive (and personally not as concerned with profit + currently able to mine btc for ~4250 each), but I believe many miners would give up a small additional % to the pool in the interest of running v2. It's a long term investment in the network, and miners are aware our massive capex investment relies on the network staying alive and more decentralized. 

It'd be even more interesting if the pool shared rewards from v1 and v2 miners.

What does it cost to run a pool with a handful of aws nodes these days? I'd maybe even be willing to bear the entire cost personally, tbh. I know the instance cost is irrelevant, it's a matter of bandwidth costs I guess.",t3_m16uon,2021-03-11 06:19:27,2021-03-11

It seems to me that the idea here is, you have an online system and an offline system. The online system has a watching-only version of your wallet, allowing it to receive money and be monitored (but not spend). The offline system is what has the private keys, so if you want to spend bitcoins, you manually sign transactions on the offline system, and then send those signed transactions to your online system via USB transfer or something so they can be processed on the online system.

My question is this: if you have an old laptop sitting around, is there any advantage a hardware wallet has over this setup? (Besides the fact that the larger size of a laptop makes it more susceptible to theft/damage than a tiny hardware wallet.)",t3_m2jh3u,2021-03-11 17:23:08,2021-03-11

Edit: you can change the number of wallets generated to a million per second and you will still only be at 1x10^(-22) % chance of duplicate after 10,000 years

You also don’t **do** transactions. You **create** a transaction, you **sign** a transaction and then you **publish** a transaction. That’s the process, every wallet from paper wallet to custodial goes through that process, yes even the magical coldcard doesn’t work on fairy dust and rainbows.

Everyone can create a transaction, I can create a transaction from any wallet to any other wallet with a piece of paper and a pen. 

I can also sign that transaction, no problem at all. No internet required for that either.

Now I have to publish it though because what use is a transaction nobody knows about? Now you need internet, it’s a signed transaction, it can’t be changed anymore so safety is a nonissue, you can post it on Twitter if you want. 

Privacy is another thing, yes a VPN helps a tiny bit with a very specific subset of privacy, aka hiding from the operator of the node you interact with the connection between your bitcoin transaction and IP. That’s it. It doesn’t hide from any government agency that you kyc with, nor from any exchange your coins touched.

P.S. The transaction from any wallet to any other wallet that I can create, sign and publish will only be accepted by nodes if I signed it with the correct key which is a admittedly smaller subset of possible addresses.

Whether you use an airgapped laptop, or a hardware wallet, you should keep a separate backup of your seed phrase.  So if the device gets damaged, you still have access to your coins.

If you use an airgapped laptop, and someone steals it (or accesses it - the so called ""evil maid"" attack) - they could steal your coins.  You can mitigate this risk by deleting your private keys (i.e. your wallet) from the machine.  When you need to spend some bitcoins, you restore your wallet from the seed phrase backup to the offline machine, sign the transaction, then delete the wallet.  So at any given moment, if someone steals the laptop, you don't care, there's nothing on it.",t3_m2jh3u,2021-03-11 18:18:49,2021-03-11

The laptop must be always offline and must have never ever connected to the internet in the past, or connected to anything that has ever been connected to the internet in the past (including usb sticks) since a previous total wipe. This requirement alone precludes most users.

You must then find a way to get software on this laptop that can generate private keys,
and seeds from those keys. And this software should be securely storing these keys in memory isolation. But this must be done without connecting to the internet, and without connected a device that has ever connected to the internet. Still think you can manage this?

There are more steps involved here but I think you get the point. A hardware wallet does all of these things for you. It is single purpose built by experts who know exactly what they are doing, subjected to significant security scrutiny and tested. Is there a trust element? Sure. Is that trust element lower risk than the risk of you losing your funds because you tried making your own hardware wallet and failed miserably? For sure.",t3_m2jh3u,2021-03-11 19:39:16,2021-03-11

934,gqkk4ut,t1_gqkio0j,"It was easier to buy bitcoin back then and you didn't have to do all of the KYC that you do now. I went into great detail about it on here yesterday. Bitcoin exchanges have been around since 2010 and people also mined it themselves at home using normal retail hardware from until late 2013. We mined on personal computers from 2009 until around sometime 2012. People were using mutli-gpu setups before 2012. The field programmable gate arrays were even being used to mine bitcoin by mid 2011. Then we had avalon, butterfly labs, bitmain and everyone coming out with ASICs in 2013. Coinpal started January 2010 and let you buy bitcoins using paypal and then mtgox started later that year. Bitstamp, kraken, bitinstant, and btc-e all started in 2011. Bitinstant allowed you to buy bitcoin with cash at walmart but you could only buy a maximum of $500 at a time and they closed in 2014. Coinbase and localbitcoins both started in 2012. From 2011 through 2013 there was several exchanges like bitcoin-24, bitfloor, blue sky traders, and more that let you just walk into a bank with under $10k cash and just fill out a deposit slip and you'd receive your bitcoin shortly later that day and they didn't require any KYC and it was so easy lol and coinbase didn't even used to require your name in 2012 and 2013.  You could also buy directly from people on bitcoin-otc or from people on bitcointalk as far back as 2010. Gavin ran the bitcoin faucet back in like 2010 and it gave you 5 bitcoin per day per IP address for filling out a captcha to prove you're a human and I even remember someone in Spain once kept changing their IP address and emptied out the faucet. Here's a [thread on the bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92.0) from 2010 that I'll never forget where user tried to sell 10,000 bitcoins for $50 and it never sold because the most anyone was willing to pay for ten thousand bitcoins was $25. I know I'm forgetting a lot of smaller exchanges but you get my point that it was pretty easy for people to buy bitcoins if they actually tried. If someone didn't even visit bitcointalk forum or this subreddit or do any google searching then of course it was almost impossible buy bitcoins lol because they didn't even try haha",t3_m2prh5,2021-03-11 21:34:41,2021-03-11
944,gqkmlme,t1_gqkk4ut,"I can see you know your stuff but for the general public it was a struggle to buy back then since there weren't many exchange platforms and you didn't know which one was safe and which one wasn't.

What I don't get about Peter Schiff is that he calls bitcoiners ""brainwashed"", but brainwashed people throw out what they know to be true to worship what they believe.  
Peter Schiff:  Gold will go to $5000 an oz, and bitcoin will never hit $50,000.  


He knows the truth.  Gold never went to $5000, not even half of that.  Bitcoin is over $50K.  Yet, he won't admit he's wrong and maintains what he believes instead of the truth.  So, by definition, he is brainwashed by his love of gold.  


Now, bitcoiners don't have a lock on the truth.  I think most of us have done the research, and we believe that bitcoin is the new gold, the better store of value, and may even become a widely used currency.  So far, the truth has supported these theories.  It could change, and we would have to admit we were wrong.

2496,gqgpin6,t1_gqg3sfu,"It's a little more complex than that because even if you don't have trust in the US Dollar, you still have to collect them in order to pay taxes.  And the people collecting those taxes have guns to force you to do it.

In fact, the US Dollar derives its value at root from the requirement to pay taxes with it.  If you didn't need to pay taxes with it then you wouldn't bother to collect it.  And if no one bothered collecting it then banks would stop making systems to keep track of dollars.  And people would stop accepting them as payment.  The dollar used to be tradeable for silver/gold but that is gone now.  Another thing that the dollar depends on is faith that the government will continue to accept it as payment.

You can say that the dollar also has value as a thing that is tradeable and fungible and whatever value it has as paper (you could use it as a bookmark) but that's less of its value.

The amazing part about bitcoin is that no one demands it yet people still value it.  I think that's because people *do* want a store of wealth but they also want it decentralized and anonymous and fast.  And they don't have faith that the dollar will be a good store of wealth.  So the value of bitcoin comes not from people with guns but just from its usefulness, like how a hammer is valuable only for how good it is at driving nails.

It won´t happend from one day to another. It will start from the companies giving employes the possibility of getting paid in BTC instead of dollars, and slowly it could be the new normal. There are some companies that pays on BTC right now so thats the begining, but it will take many years to be normal.

Also if you don´t suppose it already, in case it is adopted as an everyday currency, a chicken prize would be 30 Satoshis, to say a number, who knows?. People won´t need to convert from $ to ₿, as they get paid on Satoshis.

My guess? Companies and big fishes are confident on Bitcoin as an store of value, just for now. They are here to hodl, so if its remains as an store of value i couldn´t care less.

You had to have a lot of faith to buy into bitcoin at $20.

About the same amount of faith that you do to buy into bitcoin at $50,000, in fact.

Bitcoin remains the opportunity of a lifetime.  For now.

Here's the faith part, but with time it will become an inevitability just as $50k bitcoins were inevitable from the moment Satoshi mined the first block:

THE END GAME is the replacement of all fiat currency as a reserve instrument, and eventually the replacement of government as we know it.  Somewhere along the way, you won't be worried about how much bitcoin costs but rather how many satoshis does it take to buy breakfast.

For those who think my idea is extreme, what is the most fundamental purpose of government?  It is to provide trust among strangers.  We trust that all the people we meet will generally follow the laws and social contracts, because if they don't then we have trust that the government will deal with them accordingly.

Bitcoin replaces the core purpose for political governance to exist.

The purpose of bitcoin is to establish trust in untrusting environments.  It is right in Satoshi's original whitepaper.  He threw the glove down and ten years later his dream is becoming something that is starting to look more attractive than fiat to more and more people.

But how many people even in this community understand the glove that Satoshi threw down a decade ago?  It is a thought experiment in functional anarchy, one which was intended from the start to dissemble every political power structure on the planet.

So far, it is proceeded as well as could be expected, and the most entertaining part of it is that even the enthusiasts do not see what is coming even from their own mouths and fingertips.",t3_m1wvok,2021-03-11 03:25:58,2021-03-11

I was thinking ahh relief bitcoin is shitcoin after all and it's gonna tank even more. Welp there went my second chance. Now flash forward to 2016-2017... I get back in I buy .2 @ 3k.... I file for bankruptcy and my lawyer says do you own any crypto? If so you need to sell it off ... Or else it may hurt your chances at a successful bankruptcy. So I sold... Man...

2997,gqjjbrt,t1_gqj78nk,"Most likely that the shorts are so high because the stock is overvalued and eventually the price will go down and the hedgefunds that shorted at the top will make their money back plus profit.

Some apes profit, other apes hold the bags, and hedgefunds that survive walk away just fine.

Short squeezes are studied and prepared for by those that participate in shortinf, and have the risk assessment baked into the cake of how to handle it.

Stock shorted at $20 but jumps to $400? Well let's short it again at $400 and when it hits $20 again we even out or make a profit depending if it's an outside short, leading to squeeze shillers pointing out that it is still shorted at 100%+ because it is overvalued, leading to yet another cycle of folks buying in to ""stick it to the hedges"" while the end up shorting at the top for a profit.

But I do endorse the short squeeze and holding firm to limit avaliable coins, err stocks, that are available to trade, putting the hedgefunds in a hard place to either buy back at a loss or eat the daily, so hodl shares and make em pay, but be careful of FOMOing on the uptick and ending up holding bags.

The way I see it, (besides get rich quick fantasies) people instinctionally, without contextualizing or articulating, know that the trillions being injected to the market will devalue their savings so they are throwing it at a limited supply store of value asset, thus breeding a holder and diamond hands.

It's very possible when the squeeze runs its course and it is news that hedges made money off us plebs, that folks dig deeper into fundamentals of money and why crypto is the store of value folks were looking for.

As you correctly state, the hashrate is more directly correlated to power usage. What market mechanism determines how much power is used? The block reward, multiplied by the valuation of bitcoin, because that is what incentivizes mining. With rational actors, mining energy expenditure will always expand or contract to get close to the value of the block reward.

Roughly, if Bitcoin's value goes up by 2x without the block reward experiencing a halving in the same time frame, the total amount spent on mining will double, too. Doesn't matter whether energy is cheap or expensive. Fortunately, the halvings generally reduce the hashrate again as miners drop off the network when they become unprofitable.

3268,gqjr36e,t1_gqjnd0a,"Right, I did oversimplify quite a bit by ignoring the challenges of mining with specialized equipment. In the real world the mining energy consumption *does* lag behind the reward value a bit, since scaling up one's mining operation (especially when ASICs are sold out everywhere) is neither free nor instant.

But it does tend to catch up -- a prolonged gap where mining rewards are so much higher than mining costs as to be uber-profitable will naturally lead to increased mining equipment production. Or even in the total absence of new equipment being available, miners would put older less efficient models back into service if the rewards are so good that those less-efficient miners are temporarily still net-profitable. Same goes for cheap electricity -- if you can't get more cheap electricity, but the reward is still skyrocketing due to increased USD/BTC valuation, it may be (momentarily) profitable to use more expensive sources of electricity for mining.

What I find most strange about Bitcoin's design is the arbitrary nature of the block reward. After all, the point of mining is security, right? Security against a double-spend. How much security is ""enough"" security? Well, intuitively, if executing a double spend could get me $X in ill-gotten gains, the network must spend at least $X-1 on mining over the timeframe that a double-spend attack would take. Otherwise I could spend $X-1 to out-mine the whole network, do my double spend and get the $X in returns, with my whole attack operating at a $1 profit. (Again, I over-simplify and ignore the cost of acquiring mining equipment -- but consider that I might execute my attack by paying miners a premium for hashrate instead of directly buying my own equipment).

I don't know what $X is. I don't know if it's possible to calculate. Obviously it isn't simply ""the largest amount anyone could spend in Bitcoin"". It's a lot less than that, because there are other problems for the attacker like the damaging effect their attack would have on BTC's valuation and the challenges in getting their money out of the system without getting caught. On the other hand, the attacker might try to short bitcoin externally (e.g. on CME) to take advantage of the loss in confidence from a 51%, so rather than just ""I got to spend my bitcoins twice"" as the reward, they are getting profits from their short bet paying off. How much might that be worth? Again, I have no idea.

But Bitcoin doesn't seem to try to calculate $X, either. It set the amount paid to miners at... 50 BTC (plus fees). Then 25. Then 12.5. Then 6.25. Eventually, 0 (still plus fees).

People seem to pay a bit more in fees after halvings, but not so much that it covers the whole difference since the last halving. E.g. the fees per block weren't making up the missing 6.25 BTC when we went from 12.5 BTC block rewards to 6.25 BTC block rewards. So the overall amount spent on mining does take a hit each halving. Does that mean the halvings are making the network less secure? If it's less secure, but still secure *enough*, was it *too* secure before the halving? In other words, more was being spent on security than is really necessary to prevent a 51% attack? How much more?

What about when the reward goes to zero? Is there a relationship between that magic $X number I mentioned that is the ""prize"" for a 51% attack, and the amount the network is willing to spend on fees? Do we know that the latter number is necessarily bigger?",t3_m2gb9a,2021-03-11 15:50:16,2021-03-11

3271,gqka0xq,t1_gqjr36e,"The dynamics are really straightforward. All the money that miners earn comes from the block reward, so the coinbase (currently 6.25 BTC per block) + transaction fees.

The income of a miner sets an upper limit on their expenses — to stay profitable, miners cannot spend more than they receive.

Since miners earn BTC and the 6.25 BTC coinbase reward is a large chunk of the total income of a miner, the price of Bitcoin basically sets the budget of a miner in fiat terms.

Since the price of BTC has been going up, miners have more budget available to pay for energy, operating expenses, mining equipment, etc. The energy usage is going up as a result of the current raise in price. An additional reason is that at current price levels less energy efficient mining equipment may again become profitable, which in turn results in a slight overall reduction in the energy efficiency of the network.

Another aspect of energy usage is that to be profitable at all, miners must normally have access to dirt cheap energy. A significant amount of mining power comes from excess energy of Chinese hydropower plants. This energy is cheap because it would be wasted if not consumed. A similar effect is to be expected for wind and solar energy. It’s highly uneconomical to store energy, so excess wind and solar energy usually is wasted if there’s not enough demand on the grid. Electricity prices are set on an hourly basis and can even become _negative_ if there’s no demand for power. By using this excess energy for mining, it won’t be wasted and may even improve the business case for a renewable energy plant.

So although Bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy, a significant amount of that energy is renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted.",t3_m2gb9a,2021-03-11 19:36:31,2021-03-11
3272,gqk6j7d,t1_gqjr36e,"**TL;DR**:

The total **cost** of mining (which is mostly electricity cost) is **not** set by a certain security level the system wants to achieve, but by **market demand**!!

In the initial distribution phase we are in right now, the cost of generating a new coin should tend towards the cost on the free market, which can **not** be set in advance, but only found (by people thinking it over and over, adjusting their view on the topic as time passes by)!

The more people join, the higher the demand, the higher the price rises, the higher a maximally big transaction can securely be done on the network.

- - - 

More details (I think the tldr is more important than the following details):

The  fair DISTRIBUTION of a NEW currency is a very hard problem (a LOT harder than it seems, especially if you a) want a global adoption and b) the “product” is so radically different that close to no one will understand it in the beginning).

Satoshi therefore made these 2 design decisions: 

- early adopters will have an incentive to join, as there is a fixed supply and until the project is understood by all, the price of one coin should most of the time be under the long term equilibrium (that will be found by the market after many years), at least if the project works as intended (so you are rewarded because nobody can know for sure if it will really work out in the end)

- the mining of new coins should be done in a way to try to not enrich anyone (tldr: cost of a mining follows the price of a coin), at least not marginally more than buying from the free market, as mining is decentralized and no permission/registration is needed and therefore: 

> a) mining competition will exist, because energy is available almost everywhere

> b) competitive advantage should be as low as possible [1] and thus margins [2] will tend to 0. Theoretically infinitely close to 0 and practically only marginally. It will tend to 0 after A) production of new chips has cached up AND B) the 2 week algorithmic adjustment has adjusted the difficulty which will influence the hashrate (difficulty adjustment takes place every 2016 blocks).

And the block reward is halved every 4 years. Unless transaction fees rise to compensate, then the ""mining budget"" relative to the total value of BTC will decrease over time. It can still increase in absolute terms, but ""efficiency"" of the chain will rise over time most likely. 

Unless fees rises faster than block rewards are reduced as I mentioned, but if so that would mean the value of the network has increased massively (else transaction fees wouldn't amount to that much)
