1463,gtbd20g,t1_gtbc8gb,"Yep. Like I said above, I made 46,000 SAT today, which is like $26.41 USD. Across my 3 computers, let's assume I'm using 1KW of power (a high assumption, but lets roll with it). I pay 0.094 USD per KW/h of power, so $2.25 USD per day in power costs, for a profit of $24.16. I have spent $2800 on my 4 GPU's so far, and have already made ~$800 in BTC from mining payments.

Today was abnormally high in payments, so let's assume the average profit is like $20 per day. At this rate, in 100 days I will hit the break even point. That's effectively the same thing as me doing $2800 in DCA investing into Bitcoin, at the end of which I get $2800 in free GPU's as well. 

This isn't without risk, since if ETH mining becomes unprofitable before I hit that return on investment point I do not break even, but since the GPU's have value of their own, I feel that as long as I get 50% of the way to breakeven point I can sell the GPU's to recoup any losses and at least come out where I started. The potential upside is that I could mine all the way until 2022 before ETH goes to proof of stake and mining isn't profitable. EIP1559 is coming in July as well, meaning profits will be cut in half. It's why that 100 day thing is so important... I wanna hit profitability before profits are cut in half, because at that point I'm already in the black.

It's also very difficult to buy GPU's right now. I've been entering the Newegg Shuffle, and have gotten lucky 3 times so far. I also bought my 3080 back late last year, when the scalped price was ""only"" $1200, so I was able to get that at half what they currently go for fortunately.",t3_mjlr6h,2021-04-04 11:59:13,2021-04-04

2434,gtcl6uh,t3_mjom8c,"I think Coinbase direct listing will cause regulatory issues for the next 2-3 years.  Here's why I think so:

The main issue is that Coinbase is being direct listed during a boom year.  First, for direct listing you have initial price discovery.  During this price discovery Coinbase is believed to be overpriced by 3x.  The overpricing is likely due to the boom year happening.  

The interesting question that arises from the issue, what will happen to Coinbase stock price once cryptos crash after the boom?  If Coinbase stock price prices in Crypto prices then Coinbase stock will be significantly overpriced.  Once boom stops then Coinbase stock is likely to drop.  Lots of people will lose money on Coinbase speculation.  What will be the result?  Crypto will be set back 2-3, maybe more, years based on possible regulations to protect the public.

In conclusion, I'm not really excited about the Coinbase direct listing.  It's very possible that a lot of people will get burned and it will set a bad precedent for Cryptos - just because the damn direct listing is in a boom year.",t3_mjom8c,2021-04-04 22:23:57,2021-04-04
