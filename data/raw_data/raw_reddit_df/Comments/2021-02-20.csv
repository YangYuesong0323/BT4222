110,go1aqkl,t3_krqrmf,Random question: If I bought a ledger nano x could I just use the recovery phrase from my ledger nano s and load up my wallet? Or do I have to manually transfer them?,t3_krqrmf,2021-02-20 02:53:29,2021-02-20
111,go1gyzc,t3_krqrmf,"Here's a thought I need to look into.  When I sell bitcoin and cash out or spend Bitcoin later on when people have that ability I will have to declare the gains on my tax return and it will be considered either short term or long term capital gains because the USA doesn't recognize bitcoin as currency instead they look at it like stock.        Can you imagine if btc becomes widely usable and the headache of managing to it cost basis from day to day as you spend Bitcoin on everyday transactions.  Haha. This tax problem is only because the irs considers it stock and not currency.  If they change there view of currency then it'll be easy on tax day but then the government won't get their piece of the pie.  So people claim btc is decentralized but it's actually only decentralized in software but not tax implications because as long as your a citizen of a country then that country can impose any tax on the crypto that it wants.  Which will lead to another problem,  I think people will start apostatizing from their countries and and ripping their citizenship up because the tax man will come..... leads to the next question,  will there be a global citizen designator in the future to escape all the countries tax codes and governance?  This issue is fun to think about.... I feel they should make a movie about it if they haven't already.   Also my next question.  If we pay capital gains tax on bitcoin because it goes up on value how is that fair?  The only way that would be fair is if our government treated their usd the same way by the same rules.  But they have the opposite problem of inflation which leaves our dollar worthless by like 2% a year.  Does this mean we should get a tax break from the irs every year at 2% our income because their currency is losing value?   What u think?",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-20 03:39:31,2021-02-20

4. Don't shitcoin, they all lose value vs btc over time and you create a capital gains taxable event every time you trade between them.  something like 95% of traders lose money.  just hold bitcoin, it's that simple.  
5. Just transfer your binance coins to your bluewallet and use swan to DCA weekly going forward.

When your coins are on Coinbase you don't actually own any coins, you own an IOU from Coinbase for your coins. You have to ask permission to access them and they could say no for any reason.  Generally it is not an issue because they are a company and want to keep their customers happy but there is also the risk that they could get hacked, exit scam, run a fractional reserve, etc.

Yes it is just for secure coin storage and transaction signing.

Yes however I generally don't recommend Coinbase, Gemini.com is more reputable.  

> What are the fees like to transfer to trezor? 

It should be whatever the bitcoin network fees are at the time (they are variable) however companies often add their own fees on top, some are better than others about not abusing this.  

> Also, if I link the coinbase to my bank, does it mean coinbase has control over my coins, or does my bank take ownership?

Only coinbase (*ahem* Gemini) would have ownership of your coins.  Once you withdraw them to your trezor they would be yours.  Your bank is just funding the purchase with your USD account.",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-20 06:38:37,2021-02-20

379,go44ls2,t3_lo1l2j,"I first got into bitcoin in 2016, accumulated a stack of about 1.25BTC at an average price of \~$4500

&#x200B;

After watching it dip from the 2017 ATH all the way down to my average price, I decided to sell it all and buy back in when it reached the 3000s. I watched this happen, and didn't buy back in for fear that it would drop even lower.  I got greedy. Instead I just watched it rise and rise, and didn't start buying back in until it had broken 10K again in 2019. I vowed to never make such a foolish mistake again. HODL.

&#x200B;

Nowadays I have more BTC than I started with, but at an average purchase price of \~$11,000

&#x200B;

When it hit 30K, I considered selling a portion. People told me to sell a portion. I told them that I'd sell when it hit 50K. Well 50K came and went and I still haven't sold a single satoshi. 100K and beyond seems like a more realistic target nowadays than it ever has before, even though I had already believed it would eventually reach that price already back in '16. I feel like it would be absolutely foolish to sell right now, knowing what seems to be inevitable is on the horizon. 

&#x200B;

If I can just hold out until 100K, I'll be able to sell just 10% of my BTC stash and roughly pay for my initial investment free and clear. (I still DCA every week, but the bulk of my exposure is from before this latest bull run). This seems like the wisest move. I have a low 5 figure sum of debt but 6 figures of value in bitcoin. The debt is low interest and manageable, but it would still be nice to have it wiped clean, even though I'm not without income to continue paying it down slowly. 

&#x200B;

 

On the other hand, if I were to sell half my stash right now, I'd have enough cash to pay my rent for the next 5 years. If I sold it all, it would be 10 years of rent. Fully covered. (obvious math)

&#x200B;

Selling even half seems foolish. Selling all of it seems unfathomable. But selling all of it right now would be undeniably life changing whereas selling only portions would only slightly improve my quality of life. I would have roughly ten years to pursue almost any type of life change I wanted while only working a 2 day work week for supplemental income. It's an undeniably attractive scenario, but selling half my stash for ~300-400K in a few more years is obviously more attractive. 

&#x200B;

It's a very strange threshold to cross when you switch from stressing about losing money to stressing about \*losing out\* on money. To have to choose between bettering yourself *now* or bettering yourself *later*. This price action is making me a wreck. FOMO is a cruel beast. ""Can I really wait four more years?"" is something I ask myself constantly. 

&#x200B;

I've had the same amount of cash in my checking account, roughly, for the past 12 months. In that time, it's gone from representing 20-25% of my net worth to only 0.5% because of bitcoin. This is obviously the best kind of pickle to find oneself in, but it's a pickle nonetheless. 

&#x200B;

I'm going to delete this post eventually, but I just needed to rant. It's so easy to convince yourself to be a HODLer for life, until the moment comes when you're suddenly worth enough to actually *change* your life. I lose sleep over this nightly.",t3_lo1l2j,2021-02-20 20:37:42,2021-02-20

A quick google shows me there is at *least* $20B in gold stocks. He just told all of them to either buy real gold or bitcoin. My guess is that most are just going to buy bitcoin.

>Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.

He is equating money to data. Which it always has been in a way, but more commonly so since digital banking. Seems obvious to me, but maybe not everyone else? I honestly have no idea what people who aren't investing in bitcoin are doing because it sounds crazy to me, but I digress. Hopefully it makes more people feel comfortable with the idea of crypto. Now you just have to offer them this choice for a saving account

Central bank: 1% guaranteed (I think I'm being very generous here)

Bitcoin 200% on avg.

The checks are supposed to be for keeping food on your table, your lights on, and your other basic needs.  The local restaurants are getting crushed in a marathon of difficulties, stores are suffering, many businesses have grinded to a halt. The motive of the govt is often wrong, but keeping some money in people's hands is the right thing. If BTC was the only currency/store of value, I'd hope they'd be giving BTC to those who need a safety net to avoid desperation, cold, and hunger. And to avoid cool businesses closing because of an unusually bad year that would be hard to plan for. I'm afraid my favorite comic book store is going to close in NY so if I got a check I'd go and spend some there so that f'n store is there in 5 years. So while getting rich would be very nice consider this, the airdrop of money is MUCH less than many people need. Many people need 2K per month until, say, their catering business picks back up to normal in fall 2021 (hopefully). The US has only seen fit to give a couple of checks and that was barely pushed through congress. Going on and on about how the check would have made more money if it A) Wasn't spent, B) Was used to exit the USD, and C) Was used to ""gamble"" only makes it harder for checks like this to be issued.",t3_lo3dn6,2021-02-20 21:09:14,2021-02-20

Major companies/hedge funds also started buying into Tesla last year.

Were it went up 2000% and still it had 2 massive pullbacks(both after 5 month) because big companies also rather buy cheaper when they can.

They just don't act so much on FOMO/FUD

If you don't think Tesla is a good example. It is pretty much the same for every bullmarket in history. I would be really interesting when someone could find 8+ month uptrend for anything.

&#x200B;

When you never bought bitcoin before is it really the smartest decision to go in now with 100% and hope for a very unlikely event(which can happen) is the question.

I just think DCA is good for these situations where you feel like you want to FOMO in.

This is no investment advice. Everyone has to do these decisions on their own.",t3_lo3dn6,2021-02-20 22:22:01,2021-02-20
1383,go49arw,t1_go46e02,"&#x200B;

""buy when there's blood in the streets"" is one of the first things you learn investing in anything. The 1200 hit right at that spot.

Would you agree that there is now more fomo and optimism about bitcoin? because that is usually not the best time were you fomo in.

Check out starting DCA after a 5-month uptrend. It paints another picture.

&#x200B;

It's possible it will go up a lot higher before coming back down, and might not ever get below this for a long time (probably will, but it might not). Assuming you're not planning to cash out for several years (and if you're only putting in like $20 every 1-2 weeks, hopefully you won't feel the need to cash out), it will eventually accumulate, and you'll have a lot more money once we enter the next bull market.

Think of it like a 401k. People don't usually try to time their 401k buys (some are well off enough they front-load it at the beginning of the year sometimes, but most don't), they just have some taken out of every paycheck without them having to spend any time or energy thinking about it.

Revenues represent productive economic output. That's something to be proud of.

Profits, on the other hand, is a financial suprlus which is either paid to shareholders or retained in the company as reserves. Neither is really essential.

For a growing company it's normal to have profits close to zero. It's stupid to take money out of something which is growing. It's stupid to increase reserves when you can instead invest into expansion.

Having a profit is important when you have a small business like shop or restaurant: that's how much you earn as an owner. For public companies it's different, usually shareholders only care about shareholder value, and profits represent some fluctuations in market prices and demand.

I don‚Äôt know the exact figures of how much cash Tesla has made by selling shares when the company price skyrocketed, but I do believe that their car sales are no more than 30% if their profits. 

Tesla was able to do all of this mainly due to insanely good marketing. They operated for over a decade constantly on a loss. With fresh money being poured in the company every now and then. At one point even Mercedes and Toyota came to the rescue. 

I am not bashing Tesla here. The whole world will be better off when ICE goes away. But Tesla was able to become what it is bot because of their glamorous engineering or anything of this sort. It‚Äôs because they have been successfully selling a dream for over a decade. And this is cool. But it wasn‚Äôt engineering or stuff. It was a promise that they managed to deliver in over a decade. During which they were helped a lot by investors, other companies, the US state, and basically everyone.

I do expect them to start making lots of money. But without their stock price rocketing to unimaginable and obviously stupid levels - this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible. I would say that Robinhood is probably the greatest catalyst for Tesla‚Äôs success. 

Just like most of bitcoin‚Äôs early investors are not old money but ‚Äúwanna be new money‚Äù, Tesla is the favorite of dudes with 10k looking for a moon to make them millionaires.

EDIT: people went crazy on this comment and started defending Tesla. I never said Tesla‚Äôs engineering sucks. But it did not bring a 700bn valuation.

I'd argue that I would only invest in a company based on the NPV of future profitability.

Today sales of cars have created profitability. Tomorrow, it will be once they crack Utilities (Solar City division).

As far as Bitcoin. I see it as better place to hold cash reserves on hand. Most companies the size of Tesla, have cash on hand on their balance sheets. Tesla has put a reasonable portion in Bitcoin while still maintaining Fiat currency as well.

2047,go4a5hr,t1_go40nss,"Heh, I'm not gonna try and shut down your argument by telling you to short them. You have a valid question and I wanna tackle it head-on.

I'd argue that your POV excludes legitimate revenue streams as ""not fundamental"". I think people take an overly purist view and expect that any money *not* made from selling cars is somehow inferior and shouldn't be counted. But money in the bank is money in the bank. 

I'd also argue that selling stocks or issuing debt isn't free money - debt has to be repaid, and new equity dilutes the existing shareholders. If the share price quadruples, it's the shareholders that make money, not Tesla itself. 

So you seem to imply that a company could hypothetically issue shares forever and just live off that. But it can't happen because you'd just be trading money in the bank for money owed to shareholders. Plus no-one would buy the shares if the company doesn't have fundamental value to someone. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think most large businesses are very complex arrangements of direct revenue, ancillary revenue, financial instruments etc. From GM to Bank of America, they're all doing the same thing as Tesla. 

But I think people scrutinise Tesla much more because it's a new and interesting business. If you're wary of their financial practises, then I hope you never look at a company like Boeing!

My position is that as long as Tesla is subject to the same laws and practises as others, then there's no reason to be alarmed. And if we are uncomfortable with the way its revenue is assessed, then we should also apply that same standard to all the other businesses we invest in.

The information on their website is laughably sparse when it comes to buying a car that is arguably radically different from anything you might have ever driven before.  The details about how the entire process works is made opaque, rather than transparent.

But whatever. You're bitcoin rich and just buy it on a whim.

You still have to worry about the shoddy quality of the damn things.  Nightmare after nightmare stories over the years:

* panel gaps
* automated driving accidents (even leading to death of the driver)
* windows and roofs just flying off the car
* shitty paint jobs
* $1000 door handles that have to be replaced 'regularly'
* bumpers flying off in puddles
* battery fires (not many, but still)

Most of us here think this cycle will continue going up for a few more months, at least.  Keep in mind that it is entirely possible that it won't.  Personally, I think it will be a slower rise from here and that we won't see a huge collapse at the end, because this time most of the money flowing in is corporate, not a result of fraud as in 2013 and not a result of a speculative frenzy as in 2017.

Also, be sure your family knows not to talk about it to anyone.  It is just as easy to steal Bitcoin as it is to steal cash.  If kidnappings are common in your area, it's even easier to demand a ransom in Bitcoin than it is to demand one in cash.  And, if you're keeping your investment on an exchange, it was very common for exchanges to disappear with all of their users' cryptocurrencies;  this happened just a couple of years ago in Canada with QuadrigaCX.

I hope you understand risks of going all in. If it goes down you got 2 options, pull out at a loss or wait months or years for your trade to be in profit. 

And be careful about convincing other people to buy. They'll be happy as long as it goes up, but might blame you or call you dumb if it goes down. Make sure you have solid relationship with whoever you recommend to buy crypto.

Digressing, apologize for bringing it down any, have a bit of a personally difficult relationship with btc (hard to get into, nothing bad, just sad) so it's exciting for that but it's also sorrt of a loaded and heavy time of friends that no longer exist because they sold their coins too early or lost them on hard drives, and or spent them on X Y or Z. The best I can is just move forward wit the wisdom that I know now and what I do have, which Im grateful for, and more than anything material, Im grateful to still be alive, even without 'moontickets and 'lambos.

3563,go310wu,t3_lniqn8,"LOL! What do all you fools think Bitcoin is currently tied to? Here's a hint: the currency of your country!

Anyone who has a lot of your country's currency - be it bureaucrats, CEOs, government leaders, silver spooned children, for example - has access to Bitcoin, and lots of it!

The narrative that Bitcoin somehow challenges the power of governments and elites is absurd.

While it's exciting that your $500 satochi investment doubled in value, remember that people who are ALREADY RICH are doubling their investments too (assuming they bought Bitcoin at one point, or will be in the future). Believe it or not, people who are extremely rich now will stay rich after Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous (what a concept! /s).

Bitcoin is just a circle jerk for 17 year old investors who think they are challenging the status quo.

Go drive to the nearest mansion, then to the run-down apartment two streets over, and realize that both will stay after Bitcoin gains popularity. The people inhabiting each of them may change, but alas: **Bitcoin doesn't solve the fundamental problems society faces, like income inequality.**",t3_lniqn8,2021-02-20 11:41:38,2021-02-20

so, my wife and i have been vegan for around 12 years. in our area, there aren't many vegans, so i usually harassed anyone at the grocery store that had tofu or oat milk in their shopping cart, in a weird friendly way, in hopes of making friends, and cooking for new people, as i love cooking for people.
one day, at grocery store, i see this weird guy with what seems like typical vegan tattoos ( solid black lines ) on his arm, and he is staring at broccoli intensely, so i figured, this guy is weird, so he must be vegan.
i approach him and ask him if he's vegan, and he looks at me like i'm a lunatic, and ask why i assumed that. i point out the broccoli and his tattoos, which he proceeds to inform me represent three people whos lives he saved while deployed to iraq, and the other arm is the three people who died in his arms in iraq.
i laugh, because i was also in iraq, and because i am bit autistic and just started giving him shit for being in the army too.
he explains to me then, that he was hooked on spice, synthetic weed for a long, long time, and he barely got off it, so he wanted to start eating real food, like vegetables and fresh things.
i got into bitcoin the next day, because he was heavvvvvvvvvvvvvvy into cryptocurrency, and taught me a lot of basics.

4081,go45cyx,t1_go315xs,"That is more or less an impossible question to answer my friend.  
And please bear in mind that I am not financial adviser nor financial expert in any way.  
I myself invested in this manner:  
I took about 30% of my savings and straight put it into Bitcoin (about 0.1 BTC).  
Then I add another 20-30% of my income each month as a continuous savings plan.  


It will not make me a millionaire anytime soon, but I have already made several percent on my initial investment. And I myself is of the philosophy that all gains are good. Because it means I have more than I started with.  
You should dream, of course. But do not set unrealistic goals in the beginning, because you set yourself up for anxiety and failure when the HODL starts to become challenging.  


Only invest money that you do not really need, as to say excess. Regardless of how you live your life. I am living cheap af in my life, cut cost on everything I can. I never spend money unless I absolutely have to these days. Which makes food/bills my biggest spending. But I still have enough to live proper regardless of my savings.  


And looking over time into the future, I might generate some serious profit. But it could take some time. It really needs one to be patient. Very patient. And bold.  
I also save some in the old ordinary stock market, but that is more for fun and learning market patterns and investing stratagems.  


Try to get the ""there will be lambos"" image out of your mind. Yeah, it is fun as a meme and all, but realistically, it might take some time to get there - unless you have a small fortune to invest.  
The more you put in, the greater the return. But asking me, you should never ever use money that are not yours (loans or whatever) or money that you actually need in order to survive or live a fairly comfortable life (assuming you have an income).  


I hope for your best. Take it slow, be patient. And let it grow over time.

We have literally over a hundred store of value tokens that have captured 20% of Bitcoin's market cap simply because of their ideologies.

4375,go45uec,t1_go3y3jm,"It is a currency, and a currency can as well be treated as an asset or as a store of value if it's currently undervalued pairing it with other currencies.

In southamerican countries like Chile a common corporate practice is to hedge against inflation in US Dollars, so corporations here buy USD just like MicroStrategy or Tesla are buying Bitcoin.

These said, Chile is relatively a stable economy, so hedging in USD is more like diversifying the country monetary risks in the US monetary risks, and it's only used mostly only in corporations. In Argentina if you didn't hedge in USD you are poor by now.

Thinking only in terms of US gets you the idea that currencies are not assets, but currencies are goods in the economy as everything else, and specially the USD is used all over the world as a store of value, specially by third world countries that rely on US loans and have high monetary risk.

In those places corporations use it, govs use it, and when it comes out, and their currency goes to fkn 0, also citizens use the US dollar as a hedge first and then adopt it as a currency, in fact that's similar to what happened in Ecuador.

So, currencies normally can't be a SOV per se because of their inflationary nature, guess what, bitcoin isn't inflationary by nature, so that rule doesn't apply, and even if it did, currencies all over the world are treated as SOV relative to another currencies.

&#x200B;

Decades from now, once average people truly understand it, the technology/scaling has caught up to demand, and the volatility has subsided due to adoption you'll find that it will also serve as a currency.

I should‚Äôve opened my mind sooner, Bitcoin was my answer. My way to take back what was stolen from us, our financial security, our future. I dismissed it way too early, I never gave it a chance to understand what it was designed for and what it represents.


It represents a distrust in the system that had failed us, that had repeatedly been rebuilt to stack the deck against us.


It represents freedom from the slavery that is the modern financial system, a system where our wealth is continually robbed from us so that too big to fail banks and financial institutions can continue to gamble our futures away.


I don‚Äôt want Bitcoin because of its value in USD, a piece of paper issued by an institution that has failed me, lied to me and robbed me repeatedly.

4506,go3jvup,t1_go3cyws,"What would you do, personally, if you heard people in Texas were paying $1mm cash for a generator delivered to Dallas?

Most people would buy every generator they could at any price and drive to Dallas. There would be a convoy of generator carrying vehicles in a traffic jam starting in Oklahoma City, Monroe, and Monterrey. It wouldn't take too long for the supply of generators to meet demand. If the demand keeps going, someone will build a generator plant in Texas to start making new ones.

This is called arbitrage. Buy low from one location and deliver (sell) high in another. Eventually supply meets demand and the price equalizes.

Now, what happens when the price of bitcoin hits $1mm? Normally markets lean into that level of demand and create more supply. When they create more supply, demand is satisfied and the price drops. But there is no possible way to create more bitcoin. 

Right now we get 900 new coins a day and that's it. If demand for BTC drops to $10, 900 new coins will be created. If demand for BTC goes to $236,774, 900 new coins will be created. Demand or desire to buy bitcoin is not correlated with new supplies of coins. If a new buyer wants to trade fiat for BTC, they either pay enough to get a current BTC owner to give it up, they buy one of the newly created coins at market price, or they don't get to own a coin.",t3_lnp95i,2021-02-20 15:10:15,2021-02-20
4507,go3nbdg,t1_go3cyws,"Regardless of how much demand there is for bitcoin, nothing changes it's supply. The fact that the price goes up, miners cannot go find more of it.  The quantity is fixed.  Miners can compete to find it first, but not to find more.  Contrast this with gold where the demand drives miners to find and mine new deposits. The ultimate mineable qty of gold is not constrained. At some point in the near future it'll be economically feasible to mine gold from asteroids. The demand for gold drives this.",t3_lnp95i,2021-02-20 16:00:04,2021-02-20
