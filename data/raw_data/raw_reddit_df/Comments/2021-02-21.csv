236,go60kv1,t1_gibw9oh,Thank you for this. Is there any reason to buy on Gemini and store somewhere else? Why not buy and store through the Gemini app? Thanks for being willing to take the noob questions!,t3_krqrmf,2021-02-21 06:52:31,2021-02-21
285,go63n54,t1_go60kv1,"Gemini is a trusted third party (meaning you have to trust them). Bitcoin was designed to eliminate the need for trusted third parties and store your wealth without having to trust any institution or corporation.  

When your coins are on Gemini you don't actually own any coins, you own an IOU from Gemini for your coins. You have to ask permission to access them and they could say no for any reason.  Generally it is not an issue because they are a company and want to keep their customers happy but there is also the risk that they could get hacked, exit scam, run a fractional reserve, etc. however low it may be.  Bitcoin's ethos is about taking personal control over your wealth and not relying on anyone else.   

Only when you remove your coins from the exchange to a wallet where you control the keys do you truly own Bitcoin because only then are you in control of your wealth.  We recommend hardware wallets as they are high security and relatively user friendly. Trezor.io is the most established.",t3_krqrmf,2021-02-21 07:19:52,2021-02-21

Here's a sobering thought. I've been buying 10% of my takehome pay regularly for a bit. 

I had a low 5 figure windfall land in my lap, and I farted around trying to figure out the cheapest place to convert that to BTC and not pay a bigger chunk in fees. 

In the several days I spent figuring it out, the price went from 35k to 47k.

If you have enough for a serious remodel *and* a used car now, I suspect it's VERY likely you'll have enough for a second house by the end of the year.

Walk the middle line with her - once it gets above 77k, agree you'll put in a limit order to sell at 70k - if it comes down, you still get your remodel and car. If it keeps going for the next 2-4 years, you get a new house instead.",t3_lord9h,2021-02-21 18:54:27,2021-02-21

1733,go6x3w7,t3_lolbr0,"Did smoking and vaping. When mint juul pods came out I was smoking about 2 pods a day. Depending on the gas station it was around 20$ average for a pack. So in 2 days I would go through 20$ worth of juul pods in a week let’s say 100$ and I did this for 2 years with same amount of pods daily. So In a month let’s say 500$ by the time year ended that’s around 5k. I’m assuming tobacco smokers go through roughly the same 2 packs a day depending on the state. So you ducking your life up for some nicotine hit or investing into Bitcoin for a chance to double triple quadruple that investment id say your decision is a godly one sir.

I tell myself I save 60 dollars a month but really it’s way more than that if I admit how much I smoked - I am on day 28 of smoke free and I was originally going to do it dollar for dollar but I ended up putting in a little bit more this first month because I was excited with the rise and got some extra money renting out my truck to snow plow. So long story but congrats - every time u want to smoke thing of the millionaires here - you can’t turn back time but u can move forward with it not gone in smoke.

Not sure how you are planning on quitting but I was a long time smoker and I read Allen Carr's EasyWay to Stop Smoking and it changed my life. I stopped smoking by the end of the book and it was the easiest thing ever, I have never even desired a cigarette since and never even had any withdrawals. I then started buying the book for people I knew who smoked, I would say about 4 out of 5 had a similar experience with it. 
Good luck with it no matter what inspires you, you are awesome.",t3_lolbr0,2021-02-21 17:50:36,2021-02-21

1881,go77t51,t3_lolbr0,"Here's my tip to quit smoking.

MAKE IT COSTLY.

Quitting and never buying cigarettes again is unlikely. You will probably have a rough day, and convince yourself to buy more cigarettes. 

What you need to do is make it hurt. After you've had a cigarette, and you're feeling guilty about 'failing', get that pack/pouch and soak it with water and then empty the soggy mess into your bin.

Eventually, the thought of paying $50 for 1-2 cigarettes, knowing you'll throw the rest away, will be so repulsive that you'll just stop.

Though, I think cigarettes are much cheaper in the US, so it might not work as well.",t3_lolbr0,2021-02-21 13:45:41,2021-02-21

you should not stop Smoking for the sake of burning money anyways but with the risk to get wealthy.

Because once you are well Suited your brain has no excuses anymore and you will Start again.
Target achieved and brainy brain whats candy, EFFEN IMMEDIATELLY!

So here is how I did stopped Smoking.
I got some drinks, a Box of my fave smokes and took  it to the garden. 
I had a celebration with my dying friend Cig, we had drinks, remembered the good (wtf we had) time we had together and the Bad Times we had ( plenty more and more intense events over life time).

Even having Cig in my mouth I was happy to dismiss him from my life for ever After the next night. 

I know I can do everything we did without him!

I got the smoke free app and I am happy to see my health progressing towrds normal.

You know whats the best thing with this Methode,
You still can spend the money into BTC .

2003,go6tmlz,t1_go6fcyv,"If you’re not just trolling I’ll give you an example of when I did this and this is why I’m quitting smoking nicotine AND cannabis.. Last year I sold $40 worth of satoshis to buy some HQDs from my local corner store cause I was broke and only had that $40 in Bitcoin and well my addiction got the better of me and I bought that $40 worth at around $9.3k USD just last year in like June or July and sold it at like $9.5k USD now if I were DCAing from that initial investment my profits would have been very nice to look at but ya know can’t look back only forward. But another example was in 2016 I said before work I was going to invest $100 into bitcoin when it was like $400 USD and well I honestly just forgot after work and ended up spending that $100 on cannabis. But no regrets because in my eyes it’s still not too late and I’ve been DCAing ever since late of 2020. 

P.S. I just looked back at one of my buys it was June 21, 2020 for $30 worth of bitcoin at the buying price of $9,346.03 USD and I received 313,609 Sats with a $0.69 fee (noice) and for reference if I were to buy $30 worth right as I’m typing this I would only obtain 51,850 Sats at the Bitcoin price of $56,547.73. So yes I’m a lil mad but that’s because I let the addiction take control of me and I lost my self control and I’ve always believed in Bitcoin but my momentary weakness has made me realize buying nicotine or weed or anything of that matter with your Sats or Bitcoin is not worth it and it makes me think of the people who spent ALL of their bitcoin when it was mere cents/dollars/hundreds because of the simple fact of supply and demand (I.E. only 21million in circulation and think about how many will not sell or are lost in an inaccessible wallet/HDD). One day we may see miners no longer mining bitcoin but literally mere Sats and all miners are mining a couple or even 1 bitcoin left but people speculate that Satoshi themselves could change the circulating supply but IMO I don’t see them doing that since they must’ve chosen that number for a reason and they use a pseudonym and haven’t revealed their identity (at least that we know of) unlike other cryptocurrency creators.",t3_lolbr0,2021-02-21 11:20:11,2021-02-21

What this taught me is that money doesn’t change people.  Getting instantly rich for many just makes them more of who they always were.

Miners are all publicly communicating on the network, so we can see which miners are participating and which ones are awarded the block rewards.

2626,go839hp,t1_go82orf,"Technically speaking, it's primary differences are that it uses a modified proof-of-work algorithm called Scrypt that was designed to make it harder for people to build big powerful purpose built mining machines. However, this is not unique to Dogecoin. Dogecoin is just a clone of Litecoin that came before it. It does absolutely nothing unique and was purely invented for the meme. 

At the time it was invented, it seemed like every man and his dog was cloning Litecoin to make their own useless currency. I even had a go myself! Dogecoin was made to take the piss out of that by ridiculing how easy it was to slap any old name on a new coin. 

I was a huge supporter of dogecoin and I thoroughly enjoyed all the joking! That was about 7 years ago though. The recent hype is nothing more than that, hype. Dogecoin is not a good long term investment imo and is not something that excites me at all, anymore. The joke served a valid purpose and it helped curb the shitcoin frenzy.",t3_lovx1d,2021-02-21 21:28:49,2021-02-21

There are some improvements to the proof-of-work algorithm that have been suggested to try and encourage better decentralisation and it's an ongoing discussion! Scrypt is one example of a different algorithm. Proof-of-stake is another interesting alternative being used by Cardano and Ethereum 2.0.

I have a little gold. 

I bought some gold, lawfully, from the national refinery in Indonesia (Logan Mulia). Coming back to Britain, I actually had to smuggle it, because it was illegal to take out of the country. If just a single customs agent or airport security had spotted it and put 2 and 2 together, they would have confiscated (i.e. stolen) it. That's how things work in much of the world. They steal it from you one way or the other if they can. In Anglo countries, they will do it bureaucratically, and make you out to be the criminal and charge you with offences. In developing countries, they will just take it. And remember, it shows up as deep black on an airport scanner.

I still keep some gold because it's an effective ransom when you're in fear of your life or need to flee the country. 

This is the mystery of gold and steel.

If you have steel, you can take someone's gold. If you have gold, you can buy steel. That's our problem with gold.

3346,go6z2wy,t3_lola70,"binance exposed scam: Binance Holdings Limited, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange conceived of an elaborate corporate structure designed to intentionally deceive regulators and surreptitiously profit from crypto investors in the United States, according to a document thought to be created by a senior executive and obtained by Forbes. Cayman Islands-based Binance is currently responsible for about $10 billion in total crypto trades per day and its founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao is one of the few known cryptocurrency billionaires.

The 2018 document details plans for a yet-unnamed U.S. company dubbed the “Tai Chi entity,” in an allusion to the Chinese martial art whose approach is built around the principle of “yield and overcome,” or using an opponent’s own weight against him. While Binance appears to have gone out of its way to submit to U.S. regulations by establishing a compliant subsidiary, Binance.US, an ulterior motive is now apparent. Unlike its creator Binance, Binance.US, which is open to American investors, does not allow highly leveraged crypto-derivatives trading, which is regulated in the U.S.

The leaked Tai Chi document, a slideshow believed to have been seen by senior Binance executives, is a strategic plan to execute a bait and switch. While the then-unnamed entity set up operations in the United States to distract regulators with feigned interest in compliance, measures would be put in place to move revenue in the form of licensing fees and more to the parent company, Binance. All the while, potential customers would be taught how to evade geographic restrictions while technological work-arounds were put in place.",t3_lola70,2021-02-21 12:12:46,2021-02-21

If you store a portion of your BTC in a place like [name here], you can keep squeezing that portion for cash as it rises in value without selling, and without owing taxes when you squeeze your collateral on it's gains that way- which is p cool.

I am not joking when I say I don't pay attention to the price of BTC when I'm putting in my order- I just know how much money I'm spending that day ahead of time.

Instead of paying bills in cash lately, I've been putting my paychecks into crypto, depositing it in [name here], instantly pulling out cash against the value, and using *that* to pay my bills (using a crypto card that pays me back 3% in crypto, which is pretty cool too).

This lets me cover my bills in cash, and build up a pretty decent crypto stash while maintaining lifestyle. It's worked out better than I could have hoped so far, but we'll see how it goes in the coming year...

BTC dropped after that. Eventually got down to 3k. I was fucking crushed. I thought I missed my window, I could of had a ton of money, I'm so fucking stupid etc.

BTC eventually got back up to 6-7k and I became a believer again. Started to buy again. Thought I was dumb for not buying at 3k (which I was) and had that thought lingering in my head...did I miss my window again? It started to drop again.  I got scared but this time I bought during the dip. Bought little chunks of BTC during the next year while it juggled around 10k for a little while. I was financially stable at the time but I kept having that thought in the back of my head that I'm missing my windows, I'm doing it wrong, I should sell etc.

But I held. Through every voice of doubt, both in my head and RL people, I fucking held. Thank fucking GOD I did that. I've made so many dumb choices in my life (like cocaine throughout my entire 20's) but I finally made a smart move. One that already has me financially stable for many years but as BTC grows so does my future and the future looks very bright. 

You may think you missed a window but you are wrong. Trust me when I say that it is still so fucking early for cryptocurrencies. Getting in at 55k might seem dumb but when BTC keeps growing that $600 turns into something quite different.

About coinbase:

- I’m also new to coinbase and I also heard about coinbase pro (better fees). I always used binance and little bit of bitstamp and now kraken.

I would suggest:

- if you only hold bitcoins for longer term I don’t see any problems to keep your bitcoins on coinbase until your hardware wallet arrive (Trezor for example)

- if you want to trade these bitcoins for example everyday, I would recommend little research on coinbase pro or/and you can use binance or/and kraken

Exodus it’s a desktop and mobile cryptocurrency wallet that can be connected with your hardware wallet. For more info please visit r/bitcoinbeginners FAQ

You can put it in a vault and still have just as much in 50 years (assu!ing no one robbed you lol). Gold is also abundant enough to be available in most parts of the world while still being scarce enough that it's relatively finite for all intent and purposes. 

Now bitcoin shares many of these properties, and improves on some of them. It's finiteky scarce, it's attainable anywhere, it cannot degrade. And the big bonus is you don't need to lug around but heavy chunks of metal to exchange it! 

What people, like the author of that article, fail to understand is just that. Bitcoin is very similar to gold in a lot of ways. There was a very good reason gold was used as primitive money, and continued to be used as reserves for representational money.

4000,go7asz5,t1_go79bme,"Agreed, especially with interest rates so low it's just artificially skewing the value of the dollar.

One thing I never wrap my head around regarding cryptos is the fact that disparate economies can arise.

Imagine a poor family in a country like India for example. They buy some BTC a year ago and now they can sell it for a profit that is likely what they would make in months. Why? Because they benefit from price appreciation due to wealthier countries buying that same crypto. It's global money/assets.
