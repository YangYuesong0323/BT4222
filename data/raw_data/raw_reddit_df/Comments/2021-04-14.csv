Seller posts the crypto on eBay as a product for purchase 

Buyer buys the product on the eBay listing And pays for it via PayPal 

Seller fulfills the order and sends the confirmation of the block to the buyer along with the shipment tracking number ups/Fedex and ships a piece of paper with the seed phrase written on it which the buyer would receive as a package with signature delivery required. 

Buyer receives the package , tracking shows delivery is confirmed , buyer uses phrase to access the wallet containing the crypto , can move it too another wallet wherever he likes",t3_mqj0f4,2021-04-14 16:59:16,2021-04-14

""well into"" is different from ""into."" Well into can be 500-700k+. Wouldn't shock me if it cracked a million. Short-term, sure, it may be low-six-figures by August. It's not impossible.

>Why did you downvote me?

Shouldn't invest if you can't wait.

Bitcoin WILL go up. WHEN it goes up is speculation. It's a solid investment but the short-term has always been unknown and it sounds like you can't wait as you'll ""be dead soon.""

To me, it sounds like you've invested money you can't afford to lose as you won't be around soon. That's irresponsible so it gets a downvote from me. If you're being hyperbolic.. then.. stop. Still don't like it.",t3_mqj0f4,2021-04-14 17:58:26,2021-04-14

Talked to him about BTC at 25k, he said ""yeah yeah i will buy"". I insist that he should not buy just because i say so, but he should do his own research and learn about it so he doesn't get weak handed at the first dip. ""It is a long term investment, the ultimate savings account""

Time passed and so I asked him if he bought when it was at 40k. He didn't.

He bought first time around 57k. Then it dipped to 50k...

Then he called me: ""get out, this is going to zero. It just dip from 58k to 50k in less than a week!!. You should get out now!!!"". I told him i just went all in with the rest of my ""DCA money"" and so he should do the same with the money he is not going to need in the short term. 

He told me that i am stupid and that i will lose all my money. 

He then procced to try to educate me that he has been reading a lot the last days, telling me there is a lot of news saying that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and i should get out before losing all my money. ""You are a good guy i dont want you to lose all your money. Just sell"".

And yeah.... of course he sold at 50k and procced to tell people at the company that bitcoin is a bad inversion and that he lost +200$ in less than a week.

He even told a couple guys to not listen to me if i talk about that ponzi scheme.

Well let me tell you my view of him after that had completely changed. I mean i knew beforehand he wasn't brilliant but aftet that i just believe he is actually stupid, like very very stupid guy. The kind of guy that could believe earth is flat in case he read about it somewhere.

2512,guh48a6,t1_guh3qj7,"Honestly it‚Äôs a more peaceful life, just buying and not thinking about it. Knowing it‚Äôll pay off in the future. Bull markets on the other hand, stress me tf out lol.",t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 19:17:40,2021-04-14
2513,gug75ac,t1_gug6sfn,I think it's time I cold storage. Anything you recommend?,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 11:33:45,2021-04-14
2516,guhmoie,t1_guh0yi8,Well I won‚Äôt be here,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 22:14:28,2021-04-14
2517,gug6gbo,t1_gug6er5,Preach! Ha,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 11:26:45,2021-04-14
2518,gugdr3g,t1_gugdnac,I plan on holding all my crypto for a long long time since I do believe it is the future of currency. But I like numbers and I like tracking how much I've made and loss (yeah it's unnecessary stress but it's what I do).,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 12:45:42,2021-04-14
2523,guha9ny,t1_gugt78x,Been seeing this same trend with a lot of ALT coins. Think they‚Äôll sell off for btc when there is a dip after 4/20. Then Btc will probably touch another ath but the alts won‚Äôt be along for the ride as hard and may lag behind,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 20:26:10,2021-04-14
2524,guh0tbp,t1_gugupsy,"Who knows, I think it we reach those numbers Ethereum might be a lot closer to Bitcoin, I definitely see the potential in it.",t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 18:30:11,2021-04-14
2525,gugglsi,t1_guggi22,For sure :),t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 13:20:56,2021-04-14
2528,guhf87g,t1_guh8osf,I just completely switched off and left my stack to gather dust (or so I thought). The last place I wanted to come was r/Bitcoin üò≠,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 21:13:08,2021-04-14
2529,guh5m9i,t1_guh423m,I‚Äôm guessing they estimated it‚Äôs final value based on the market cap of gold as an equivalent. 11 trillion USD  of gold divided by 18 mil remaining bitcoins equals approx $600k. Or..... just plucked it from nowhere.,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 19:35:01,2021-04-14
2530,guh4jdv,t1_guh48a6,I want to channel your confidence when the next bear arrives! I've been staring at the ticker for a week completely obsessing over bitcoin and since I just got in I haven't experienced the big dip + flatline market myself yet.,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 19:21:36,2021-04-14
2531,gugq7x2,t1_gug75ac,I really like trezor,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 15:37:12,2021-04-14
2532,gug8odl,t1_gug75ac,"Coldcard is top of the line for btc, trezor is also good with some other coins supported as well! I would also say avoid ledger. Coldcard is expensive but peace of mind is priceless",t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 11:49:46,2021-04-14
2533,guh4981,t1_gug75ac,"Just for some perspective, I bought lessons with a full time crypto currency trader who suggested that cold storage is actually unnecessary. Sure it‚Äôs more ‚Äúsecure‚Äù, but if you lose it or even just the password needed for it , then your money is gone. Keeping your crypto on good exchanges may actually be a safer solution for a lot of people as long as you use 2 factor authentication. Just passing on the knowledge I received, in my case I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll never be using cold storage.",t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 19:18:01,2021-04-14
2536,guh2tgw,t1_guh0tbp,ETH definitely has more to offer with many coins being powered by ETH but who knows some people believe ETH will surpass Bitcoin in the future,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 18:58:51,2021-04-14
2537,guh5zic,t1_guh4jdv,It‚Äôs absolutely horrific. Once you accept the reality of a bear market though and just resume buying it‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs a long 3 years though I‚Äôll tell you that.,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 19:39:20,2021-04-14
2538,guhpdt3,t1_guh2tgw,As someone who owns both I will be happy either way,t3_mqh4bj,2021-04-14 22:35:14,2021-04-14
