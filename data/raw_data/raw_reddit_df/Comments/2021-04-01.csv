115,gszizpt,t1_gsmi4wh,"> For those who are not aware, Roger Ver is a convicted felony.

This is COMPLETELY disingenuous. If people want to know the FACTUAL story I'll tell it. Rover Ver was a college age U.S. citizen, in the Silicon Valley area, I believe. At some point he ended up needing parts for his computer and noticed a difference between prices for a hard-drive online versus in local store ads. He realized he could buy and resell at a profit. He was instantly in business in e-commerce, before it was really a thing. Before Bitcoin ever started Roger Ver had made himself wealthy. To do so he branched out in things he could ""flip"" or sell at a profit. He looked for anything and everything, whatever could be resold marked up. He eventually even came across fireworks, things Americans love using for Fourth of July celebrations. This is where the criminal aspect comes up. I don't know the exact details but essentially the problem had to do with the illegality of shipping **explosives**. Of course something that's technically an explosive sounds highly illegal and scary, even if it's used just for entertainment purposes. Maybe Roger didn't take government warnings seriously enough (he has a strong libertarian leaning), but yes he ended up in jail over the matter. 

Now does this make Roger Ver an immoral scam artist as this poster suggests? There is nothing immoral about the way he went to jail. Anyway, Roger did his time and was so upset over it he left the U.S. and gave up his citizenship. I think he settled in Japan. Later he learned about Bitcoin, and became one of the first investors in early start-ups, like BitPay and Blockchain.com. 

As Bitcoin was evolving there was trouble brewing, because the technical limitation for transactions was seriously conflicting with the economic model which favored low fees. How the community would resolve this became a HUGE argument called the block size debates which spanned years and meant many people who had been working together suddenly became adversaries, sometimes hated enemies. The bottom line is there was a disagreement about how to handle a very real Bitcoin concern: growing fees. This remains an issue still today on BTC, with growing popularity and average fees often over $10 for a single transaction. The two sides became known as big-blockers and small-blockers. I won't go into what side I think was right, other than to say I think both had legitimate points. The problem is there was NO perfect answer, so perhaps the best thing WAS that the community split. Regardless of Bitcoin any market is better when there exists more options and competition, because it pressures builders to make the best product for end users/consumers. If that's true then it's GOOD that there are many coins competing for adoption and attention. I hope this helps set the record straight.",t3_mcd99v,2021-04-01 10:23:22,2021-04-01

139,gszpakq,t1_gszizpt,"The brief history of rBTC

A long time ago, there was only rBitcoin sub; rBTC was completely irrelevant to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. At some stage, some people, in the name of scaling, began a coordinated propaganda of promoting a blocksize increase hardfork and bashing a softfork solution named SegWit, which had been implemented in the protocol but was not yet activated, in rBitcoin. These people mainly fell into two groups, one being shills of Bitmain, the biggest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer in the world, the other being altcoiners, mainly Ethereum stakeholders. There might be other Bitcoin haters, such as bankers and remittance companies, but their identities are hard to confirm. The first group promoted the blocksize increase hardfork instead of the activation of SegWit because SegWit unintendedly disabled Bitmain's secret cheat in mining (Covert AsicBoost), which helped make them the number one in the market. The second group wanted Ethereum to dethrone Bitcoin. The second group and the rest promoted the blocksize increase hardfork because 1) SegWit fixed some fundamental development-stalling bugs in Bitcoin and freed Bitcoin to the extent that it might render their coins worthless; 2) hardforks were inherently risky even when not under attack, could be easily attacked, could easily result in chain splits, which would devastatingly damage Bitcoin's value and people's belief in it; 3) hardfork blocksize increases could easily lead to centralization, which would destroy Bitcoin. They together disguised themselves as ""Bitcoiners with different opinions"".

For a period of time, these people spammed rBitcoin with lies and misinformation, oftentimes in an aggressive way. The mods did their job and stopped them. When their operations got hard, their leader, Roger Ver, who was an early Bitcoin adopter but believed to have become a secret Ethereum stakeholder therefore a Bitcoin hater later, somehow gained the ownership of rBTC. His paid employees became mods of it. They marketed rBTC as a Bitcoin sub with free speech. They claimed rBitcoin was censored and theirs wasn't. They mainly censored the sub by hiding the posts/comments they didn't like with massive downvoting (a feature of Reddit), which would result in negative karma of the posters/commenters, which would subsequently enable a 1 post per 10 minutes limitation (another feature of Reddit), effectively stopping them from freely expressing themselves. They claimed they wouldn't/didn't remove posts/comments and they wouldn't/didn't ban ""Bitcoiners with different opinions"". The truth is, they did both. A lot. With these configurations, rBTC became the nest of them all.

Before Bcash fork, what rBTC sub did was pretending to talk about Bitcoin while spreading lies and misinformation, such that hardforks were safe/good, hardfork blocksize increases were safe/good, softforks were bad, SegWit was evil, Bitcoin development was controlled by Blockstream, only Blockstream wanted SegWit, Blockstream was controlled by bankers, rBitcoin was censored, and things like that.

Then an epic battle in the community happened. Users pushed SegWit to be activated via User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF). Bitmain created Bcash, which was basically Bitcoin with SegWit removed, to preserve their mining privilege. SegWit was activated. Bcash forked away at the same time. Bitmain moved non-trivial proportion of their resources to Bcash. But the company saw Bcash as not Bitcoin. With SegWit activated and Bitmain moving on, the altcoiners and haters teamed up to push SehWit2x, a hard fork after SegWit activation, until it failed in all aspects. After that, they lost their directions for a while. They eventually came up with a new plan, which was to support Bcash, sell Bcash as Bitcoin (both figuratively and literally) and the idea that there could be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols.

It's worth noting that there aren't many actual Bcash supporters in rBTC. They pretend to support it in order to undetermine Bitcoin.

Fun facts: Vitalik Buterin (founder and spearhead of Ethereum) is popular in rBTC. Jorge Stolfi (\u\jstolfi), a well-known Bitcoin hater who publicly filed reports to authority claiming Bitcoin (but not other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum!) a scam, is popular in rBTC.

Bonus facts: Besides rBTC, Roger Ver owns Bitcoin(dot)com website. It sells Bcash as Bitcoin by making their wallet app create Bcash wallet by default and with no clear indication. It's believed that he also owned @Bitcoin Twitter handle when it actively bashed Bitcoin, pushed Bcash, and blocked people who disagreed to prevent its followers from seeing its lies getting refuted. All of the three major Bitcoin resources are either known or believed to be purchased from other people. Purchasing subreddit is in violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.

TLDR: rBTC (as a Bitcoin-related sub) was created by a Bitcoin hater (an altcoiner); was filled with Bitcoin cheaters (miner's shills) and Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on); is filled with Bitcoin haters (altcoiners and so on). It is not a Bitcoin sub. It's an anti-Bitcoin sub.",t3_mcd99v,2021-04-01 11:24:05,2021-04-01
140,gszp9ls,t1_gszizpt,"Your comment is COMPLETELY disingenuous.

It's a fact that Roger is a convicted felony.

There are two groups of people who *used* blocksize as an excuse to attack Bitcoin:

1. Bitmain (Jihan Wu, to be specific).

2. Bitcoin haters, which most definitely include shitcoiners, and probably also include bankers.

The first group tried to stall the activation of SegWit because it would (unintentionally) disable their cheating advantage in mining (ASICBOOST, read below).

The second group simply hated everything that's done right in Bitcoin.

Both groups joined force and attacked Bitcoin in the name of blocksize/scaling.

Roger belongs to the second group. Besides that he has stakes in Ripple (a shitcoin), his btc sub is haunted with all sorts of Bitcoin haters, such as Ethereum supporters. There had been many chances that he was meant to reveal his stakes in Bitcoin, and he dodged them every time. He had long sold his Bitcoin. And the only reason he is ""in"" Bitcoin is to sabotage Bitcoin.

Read below about Bcash, which is related to Jihan Wu (Bitmain) and btc sub, which is related to Roger Ver. Both contain truths about this so-called blocksize debate.

--------

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.

What was Bcash when it was created?

In a nutshell,

1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.

2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.

3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.

4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.

5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.

6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.

7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.

7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.

Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?

Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. Bcash's dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm was so buggy that it took few seconds to mine a block, while it should be around 10 minutes, and lots of blocks were mined at that speed. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.

The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 

Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may also include bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and @Bitcoin Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Core"", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.

There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.",t3_mcd99v,2021-04-01 11:23:49,2021-04-01

The value of the effort we put in to work become less valuable with time, if we are converting that value to the fiat system. We never say money is the ultimate entity, we say money is something with which we can buy or acquire things and services of value. So won't it be better to buy stuff at the earliest, which are of more value compared to some paper money. 

All things aside, yes, this ""paper money"" was valuable at one point in history, and with the flow of time, things change. At one point of time people sold cows in exchange for rice, but it was a difficult process in the long run, so they resorted to gold coins and sovereigns and such. Compared to that, yes, this paper money is of value, as it is easier to carry fiat rather than sacks of gold. But the times have changed and the way in which we think about money also changes. Fiat currencies have started accumulating in the hands of the rich, and they are a small minority in terms of population. So history is forcing the change to move on to efficient methods of how we value money, and thus we see a rise in value for crypto. The earlier a person understands that, the better. It's true that people like Satoshi had a huge part to play in this history, but if it was not him, someone else would pave way to better systems. In the end, good shall prevail, and corruption, in people or systems, will ultimately degrade the system or the person. So in the near future, yes, fiat will be punishing if accumulated.

Sorry but this is bullshit. First, whatever your understanding of computer science is doesn’t really have anything to do with this. And then, saying those “fancy features” are mere decoration is just absurd. 

For example, Bitcoin is not scalable. Right now we’re relying on some extra layers which are completely unproven and which promote centralization to solve this problem. Yet you say a coin being scalable is just “mere decoration”. 

Like it or not, Bitcoin isn’t perfect. It can’t be used for daily transactions. It’s expensive and slow. It does have its great features, but it also has problems. Claiming Bitcoin is somehow going to change how the world works is pretty stupid. It might make the rich even richer, I’ll give you that. 

I’ll probably get downvoted by “omg Bitcoin to the moon 🚀 Elon musk” people who only care about pumping Bitcoin to get money, but who cares. I’ve been supporting Bitcoin since the early days, and each year less of the community cares about fixing Bitcoin’s issues to make it a viable currency, and more care just about getting rich. 

And by the way,

No, I would say it's a lot more than that. I kind of don't want to go into this discussion because it's been debated a billion times already but I'll do it anyways. Many of the reasons below are correlated with being the first but people forget that before Bitcoin, there were many attempts of building a digital cash. They all failed, due to one or the other reason. All altcoins are based on Bitcoin's technology, so you could say ""Why are they all not worth more if they do *more* than Bitcoin???"". I think if you think like that, you don't really get the value proposition of Bitcoin. 

Nevertheless, no other coin 

* was announced 3 months before it started and had no pre-mine 
* has had 18 months of time of existence without having a price 
* has a insane hash rate securing it
* is extremely cautious with new updates (I love this one)
* has no central authority that governs development (Satoshi is gone)
* has a market cap of 1 trillion (this is interesting for institutions)
* the largest user base / developer base / community (network effect)

If you're looking for technical solutions to niche cryptocurrency problems, you will find many solutions in the altcoin space (therefore, no, not all altcoins are useless). If you want to revolutionize money globally, Bitcoin is the solution, you don't need to look any further. Everyone else claiming to be the solution is a copy cat, and unfortunately, there is nothing they can do against that.

The point is that bitcoin is the most neutral thing we can have. it’s for people, governments and criminals alike.

The argument that it aids criminals more than it counters them is bullshit, just like it’s bullshit to say that it is or is not “private.”

Person C wants to sell 1 btc monday and person d buys it for 51k next day. If an institution holds a lot of btc and can buy and sell whenever it pleases it can sell btc for 50k every day of the week if it wants. Economics will take hold and when the institutions supply changes price will fluctuate by no were near the same as if all btc sells were on an auction type system were people would have to post the sell of the btc like posting an ad on Ebay for the sale of blank.

Cool.  In fully grokking this, we come to the understanding that bringing ""China is this or that..."" into every discussion does nothing but give power to the 0.1% of world elites who profit from having the little people fighting each other over breadcrumbs tossed from upon high.

To those that spread this kinda nationalistic FUD I say ""have you ever been to China?  Do you have any Chinese friends?""  Those that have, will realise they're the same as everyone else.

Same here in the UK when friends blather on about ""dumbass overweight Americans who are ignorant of the world outside their little bubble"".  I say ""have you ever been to America?  You'll find the average American to be just as lovely and screwed up as the rest of us.""

Do read up on Simon Dixon's (Bitcoin Capital Fund / Bank To The Future) experiences introducing bitcoin to the Chinese if you want some primary source material from bitcoin OGs.  Some fun insider stories from him of what happened when he introduced the technology to Boris Johnson and George Osbourne too ;)

I made friends with a chinese guy in my office, called Ricky Rui Zhang, I was literally earning about 30x more than he was, mainly because I had western business acumen and spoke much better English, think he might have been a gaay man, but not sure. The salary difference was incredible, truly felt good that what I had to offer which was so natural (business acumen, ethic, communication skills etc) to me, was so revered and valued in Shanghai, and yet he insisted on paying for the late light night noodle meals we'd eat together after work. I loved it, but it became a bit of a culture shock missed home so left at the end of the 12 month contract instead of renewing. The pangs of regret for leaving Shanghai back then weigh heavily on me, every day.

I would NOT recommend trying to ""sell and buy the dip"". You are more likely to make money on your investment by simply holding onto your coins, and then buying more coins with new money when the price dips, once you are financially able to do so.

It is VERY HARD to time buying and selling to try and grow your stack, even for experienced traders. Know your limits. Have patience. Please, take this advice to heart.

2767,gsxo7zw,t1_gsxn3ij,"The absolute best strategy I can recommend for people new to crypto, is just DCA (Dollar Cost Average).

That means you invest the same amount of money, on the same day, on a routine schedule, no matter what the price is.

For example, you invest $50 each week into Bitcoin, every Tuesday at 6pm. No matter what the price is. (You can do a little research into the best time and day of the week to make your DCA buy, if you want. Just doing that research will help get you some more experience in the space. And it will make you feel good. It will feel like an accomplishment.)

That way, it protects you from volatility. You won’t get the CHEAPEST price possible, and you won’t get the HIGHEST price possible, when you buy. But you will have a nice respectable average cost, over time.

As you get more experienced, you can branch out and try other things, if you choose. Just take it REALLY SLOW. 

“Live to fight another day” really applies, in crypto. There’s always more money to be made tomorrow. You don’t have to become a millionaire overnight. But if you lose everything TODAY on a stupid trade, you’re out of the game.

Good luck.",t3_mh4vyk,2021-04-01 01:16:10,2021-04-01

You have to set the price and how much you want to buy or sell then put the order on the ""book"" and if you are lucky, the market moves in your favor and your order executes and you either get your fiat or you get your btc for a fraction of the fee coinbase charges with no hidden arbitration fees.

If you buy coins direct from coinbase you are likely going to pay a small premium over the current market spot price, plus higher fees.

Think of it like the difference between selling your car on craigslist or selling it to a dealer.

It's also worth noting that Bitmain, the main mining manufacturer, was caught using a mining technique that gave it a competitive edge, but which was incompatible with Segwit, which is why they (and miners they influenced) fought it. 

The bottom line is that a self-interested single party should not dictate the bitcoin protocol, and that's what we had in the year leading up to the Segwit activation after a user-activated soft fork proved decisive in pushing things forward.",t3_mh4vyk,2021-04-01 03:16:51,2021-04-01
