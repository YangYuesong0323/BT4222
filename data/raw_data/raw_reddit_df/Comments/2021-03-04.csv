I understand Hardware wallets are safer & once I’ve got more than just £200 of BTC I’ll invest in one & take them off Coinbase. 

But my question is how do you buy/sell on a hardware wallet compared to an exchange? Seems like it would be harder? 

Also on Coinbase it’s nice to see how much in £‘s your BTC is worth & the fluctuation in price over 1day/1 week/1 month etc - Do you still get that on a Hardware wallet?

261,gpnlu0k,t1_gpnkbn1,"A hardware wallet gives you control over your own private keys.  When you keep your coins on an exchange, you trust the exchange not to confiscate your money, not to steal it or allow it to be stolen, not to go bust, etc.

Nowadays the manufacturers of some hardware wallets have begun to implement apps that allow you to manage your balance, connect to an exchange, etc., but these functions are mostly cosmetic.

> But my question is how do you buy/sell on a hardware wallet compared to an exchange? Seems like it would be harder?

Selling is harder.  Funds managed by the hardware wallet can't be sold directly on an exchange, they must first be transferred.  Buying is no harder, you still have to transfer fiat to the exchange, and after the purchase you can shift your bitcoin to the hardware wallet.

> Also on Coinbase it’s nice to see how much in £‘s your BTC is worth & the fluctuation in price over 1day/1 week/1 month etc - Do you still get that on a Hardware wallet?

The manufacturer of your hardware wallet might provide an app to support that sort of thing.  There are other ways to achieve the same result.  You could use Electrum to create a watching-only wallet that tracks in real time the fiat value of the bitcoin on your hardware wallet.

> I’m in BTC to hold for at least 3-5 years , possibly longer

You need to decide whether you're prepared to trust your funds to a third party for that length of time.  If you choose to manage your own keys, there are ways to acquire the other functionality that you mention.  The fact that it's harder to sell could be seen as an advantage if your intention is to hodl.

Edited to clarify that only selling is harder, not buying.",t3_lxkjup,2021-03-04 22:27:47,2021-03-04

Bitcoin clearly exists. And it's trading around $50k today. So it's *possible* to make money off it. And there's a non-zero probability of it going up 20x. 

The only factual, logical conclusion is that is does have some sort of value, and it's possible it may appreciate a lot more. So it would be irrational for everyone to allocate zero investment to it. 

&#x200B;

If someone says they're not investing because of their risk appetite, or because they've assessed it and they think it's going to go down, then fair enough. If you're a retiree with a low risk appetite and a portfolio full of bonds, I understand bitcoin isn't for you. 

But I still see people who should know better denying bitcoin completely. Claiming that bitcoin is currently worthless, will always be worthless and there is a 100% chance of loss and 0% chance of any profits for any investor, ever.

Allocating mental energy to it is not considered worthwhile, because they feel they are one step ahead of us in dismissing it, and we will soon realize they are right. Whereas we think, having devoted hundreds of hours, at least in my part, that we are a couple steps ahead of the popular consensus. 

It’s unlikely Janet Yellen, for example, herself did a deep dive into it, nor that her advisors did. It’s still the safe professional move to dismiss it. If you don’t believe me, assuming you work in a non crypto industry, just try being the person who says “actually there is something to this bitcoin thing,” and watch how much pushback you get. Recommending that bitcoin is valuable, to Janet Yellen, if you work in the Treasury Department, is career suicide.

Not to get too religious, but in my head it reminds me of Sunday school hearing the stories about Noah building the ark. The townspeople laughed at him, but as the raindrops began to slowly come down, then pour down, then build, accumulate, flood... at what point did the townspeople begin to realize that Noah was may have been right, swallow their pride, run for the ark to seek refuge... only it to be too late and told no?

1843,gpn6fmr,t3_lx4svz,">For those that don't know Metcalfe’s Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in worldwide.

This is a bit of a mess logically.

As a network grows linearly, there are more nodes on the network, which makes it more valuable. If it was a phone network, it's more valuable to me because there are more people I can call. If it's bitcoin, it's more valuable to me because there are more people I can send money too. This is the value being discussed.

>In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in worldwide.

This bit then conflates geometrically increasing value with increasing (exponentially?) network growth. It's effectively saying that ""if a network grows linearly it therefore grows exponentially"". Not necessarily the case.

Is there anything to suggest that bitcoin network size will increase linearly? We know it's capped out at the number of transactions it can perform for a while now.",t3_lx4svz,2021-03-04 19:50:21,2021-03-04

Impressive analysis. Great job. I think that all of our fellow hodlers completely agree with every single point you are highlighting here.

The most fragile part of the crypto bull case is, for many, regulation. This shows in your analysis as well because instead of being completely confident you take that part a little bit more conservatively (and rightfully so). You say that we can't be sure of what is going to happen and that the risk we are taking now is going to be greatly compensated in the future (if nothing too bad happens). And that's right, not much we can do, still, your points on the matter are solid. One thing that I want to add that I personally find encouraging is lobbying power. In the US for example, after the healthcare sector, finance is the one with the most lobbying power. So the fact that big banks like Goldman Sachs and Citibank are starting to develop their ""crypto plan"", and the fact that big hedge funds and private companies are investing via Grayscale etc (Coinbase going public also greatly helps) makes me very confident that we'll be seeing more good than bad from the US regulators in the future.

Also, another aspect that I find interesting is competition in regulations. Game theory suggests that governments will be competing with other governments that allow crypto-friendly regulations (Switzerland and Singapore for example) to get the most for their citizens from this revolutionary technology.

1860,gpndbnr,t3_lx4svz,"Thank you very much for the time and effort you put into this post!! Very well structured and totally worth the read, IMHO.

I got into the space 2017-2018, too. But I did not have a good understanding of what I am dealing with in terms of disruptive potential. Sold my BTC, which I obviously regret looking back. However, having done my research, I have come to understand that we are still in a very early phase, with signs of first broader adoption (esp. institutionally) stronger than ever this year. I am currently reinvesting little by little. My post here is meant to question whether this ""little by little"" makes sense.

I guess everyone agrees that we can still ""start stacking"". In the process, considering whether one should by BTC at a 37 pullback, a 45 consolidation level or wait for the ATH of 58 is like wondering at a time around 2006/2007 whether one should be buying AAPL at 25, 35 or 45 USD. (I am paraphrasing Michael Saylor here.) 

If, then, BTC is still a valid investment case, even at the given price level of 40-60, popular opinion has it one should consider a DCA strategy. You recommend this, too. I researched DCA, of course, because it is something that many in the space talk about. First, I think I am not disciplined enough to buy a constant amount of sats over a longer period of time, ignoring the price level. But that is a personal issue. Secondly, and more importantly, DCA intends to bring down overall volatility while increasing ROI. That would constitute the Holy Grail of portfolio management, of course. The closest anyone has ever come to that I guess is Markowitz with his work on portfolio theory (in short: Portfolio diversification into non-correlated assets results in less vola/risk while keeping returns constant, Nobel Prize 1990).

As far as I understand, *DCA has never been proven empirically*. On the contrary: As Constantinides was able to show in his article *A Note on the Suboptimality of Dollar-Cost Averaging as an Investment Policy* (Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis) as early as 1979, DCA does not work. Current literature supports this, e.g. Swedroe (2010). Also, a 2012 study by Vanguard, second after Blackrock in terms of AUM, found singular investments to statistically outperform DCA-invested funds.

I am not trying to be smart here. The above is all 100% Google and Wiki, really. What I am trying to say, or to ask, is this: If I find the fundamentals of BTC as a DLT, monetary innovation and digital store of value to be superb, and thus expect a unique growth path, and if I can tolerate a high degree of volatility, *why should I then not invest a larger sum today*, move it to a wallet, and HODL, instead of keeping a cash position to ""DCA it"" successively?

It averages 8 transactions a second vs Visas 47,000 a second.
If needed, the code can be changed to increase supply, assuming that 51% of the honest nodes decide on a new code. This same rule can e applied to change anything about the current structure. 
It’s now even decentralized for fucks sake. People hate the idea of the fed and yet the miners have basically replaced the fed. There’s a few mining pools that control most of the honest nodes in the network. So now instead of a sovereign state controlling it, we have rogue pools doing so.
Who’s to say there’ll be any incentive after the supply runs out? The transaction fees are meant to incentivize miners, but that’s assuming people want to tip. Otherwise transactions stay in the mempoole or crypto limbo

You don’t mention it’s drug trade origins or ties to crimes on the dark web or how no one can agree on its purpose or even the potential vulnerability of the single hashing algorithm underlying the whole system.

In fact, you even mislead your readers on a point; the number of addresses or wallets does not equate to the number of people who have invested. This means the number of people currently invested could be VASTLY over represented, which leads to another VERY important detail: 40% of all Bitcoin exists in 0.01% of wallets. That’s less than 2500 wallets. And 60% is in 0.05%!!! I wonder how this would impact global inequality or change the world order. No mention of that either. 

The next problem with your assessment is that it leaves out the philosophical implications and repercussions of the success of Bitcoin. It not only facilitates crime in the darkest circles of the globe, it makes crime EASIER than cash to fund and propagate. It undercuts governments by hindering their ability to confiscate funds used for illicit means or that were acquired illegally. What about tax evasion and its impact on infrastructure? Doesn’t it then also undercut government’s authority to uphold the rule of law? What are the implications of that? 

Sure, our current financial system isn’t perfect nor is government, but there’s always room for improvement there and a certain accountability you can hold over government officials that you don’t get with a few lines of code tied to an ambiguous owner who could be anywhere in the world.

1893,gpnbv05,t3_lx4svz,"Id like to see a bit more on usage. For example q1 2020 saw an increase of 65% in dark net purchases using BTC. These purchases can affect liquidity in BTC. At least 2 billion dollars a year - if not much much more - in bitcoin is used on the dark net. Drug dealers and cartels  are less likely to hold onto bitcoin. 

Money laundering is a big part of BTC too. I know we don't like to talk about these parts because we think it makes crypto look bad, but it's just a fact. Again this contributes to liquidity. 

Then there's the fact that when law enforcement seize bitcoin they sell it for market price. 

I'd like to see more on remittance. That's where people want to transfer cash back to home nations. I believe it's the most active legal use of bitcoin. 650 million a few years ago. That can be quite heavily impacted by high transaction fees. 

While large us institutions hedging against inflation with bitcoin is good right now, it means it can lose its place as a store of value quickly. The fact that something like 36% of Nigeria owns bitcoins is almost as interesting to me as institutional investors. 

It's important to understand that demand can change as well as supply. 

Ultimately the big take away is - there are no real fundamentals for bitcoin. Whereas a stock will have an underlying value based on its profits and dividends, bitcoin doesn't have any. It's worth whatever it's worth. 

Combined with low liquidity causes a highly volatile market. 

I dunno I'm rambling! Basically BTC is always going to be medium risk. It will always have the chance of bottoming out. 

That said I'm extremely bullish - especially for millenials with low income and little ability to save or invest in lower risk assets productively. It's the best opportunity to earn life changing money.",t3_lx4svz,2021-03-04 20:55:13,2021-03-04

I told myself if what I needed to be in the 21 million club reached a value of 10k i'd buy it and I again didn't trust my gut. Well i paid 15k for that same amount that cost me 5k 6 months ago.

Seeing the corporations buy and it now being viewed as a store of wealth I am seriously considering buy another chunk.",t3_lx4svz,2021-03-04 21:34:51,2021-03-04
1947,gplttim,t1_gpl95mz,To my understanding (and I’m still learning so correct me if I’m wrong) the scalability of Bitcoin is one of the major inefficiencies with it as a currency. Because of additions to the blockchain averaging 10 minutes and the block size being limited to 1 mb the lightning network is what was proposed to tackle these issues. This way it would be faster and cheaper for people to buy small things such as food and small items. Again this is just my early and limited understanding of it.,t3_lx4svz,2021-03-04 10:02:02,2021-03-04

1981,gpn6phb,t1_gpmawpt,"I'm not an advisor, and this is not financial advice... This is all stuff I've learned over the past several months HODLing various bitcoin funds in tax-sheltered accounts.

Understanding expense ratio is great when parking money in any fund... That said, if you want to understand the movement on the various bitcoin funds you need to understand the types (there's basically two): closed ended funds (CEF) and exchange traded funds (ETF). 

CEFs sell a bunch of shares in an offering then use the proceeds to buy a set amount of bitcoin whereas ETFs buy/sell bitcoin based upon the inflows/outflows to their funds. 

Once you know which kind of fund you're dealing with, you need to understand their market price against their Net Asset Value (NAV).

Essentially, NAV is how much bitcoin these funds own which can then be used to calculate NAVPU (per unit). NAVPU is how much bitcoin you get for each share of the fund. So, for example, say a fund has 0.001 BTC Per Unit... at $50k/btc, NAVPU would be $50. 

But, market forces mean these funds either face inflows (people rushing to buy during a bull-run) or outflows (people reading FUD and selling, or a competing fund lowers their expense ratio, or a shiny new ETF is launched - more on this later) at any given time. This leads each fund to either trade at a premium (more than NAVPU) or a discount (less than NAVPU). This means, share price is actually be more or less than the actual value of the bitcoin in the fund.

In early January, all CEFs were trading at a premium as people rushed in to buy... But now most CEFs are actually trading at a discount! All, that is, except for OBTC which is currently trading at ~60% premium to NAV!!! That's, quite frankly, insane. In my opinion, this is a crash waiting to happen for this ticker. If not an outright crash, then definitely a bleed-down back towards NAV. 

I have no vested interest in OBTC or GBTC; I can't trade them on my platform. I just saw this happen recently in Canada with my holdings in QBTC-U and BTCG-UN... They were trading at a premium as I averaged in, only to fall to a discount once BTCC (new etf) went live. 

Long-term, you should expect most funds to stabilize near NAV minus expenses... For CEFs, Annual Redemption of Funds is one thing that should, in theory, bring these funds closer to NAV. I haven't read the prospectus for either GBTC or OBTC, so I don't know if they have such a redemption option. Also, the possibility of a massive bull-run can't be discounted. 

With the potential for new bitcoin ETFs hitting the market in the near future that have share prices that will much closer track NAVPU... I feel we could see the premium depress to a discount on OBTC, meaning you could potentially see ~60% of the market value disappear. 

You can calculate premiums/discounts yourself by checking the various websites each fund maintains, or you can check out [this website](https://bitbo.io/) which has them listed half-way down the page. I'm not affiliated in any way, it's just been very useful for me to target my buys lately.

Keyloggers, viruses, ransom ware, etc can’t hit your finances if it’s not on your network. Remove the elements of curious children and you’re golden. Maybe they can use that PC once they’re older and more educated and responsible about internet safety.

here is the post with links to twitter photos... after reading this in full it sounds like the bot took an INNITIAL sum of money, invested it 203 times total to gain a 1000% profit on the initial sum, 65% of trades were profitable with an AVERAGE return of 3% per trade, the bot keeps investing the same money everytime so when it makes 3% the next 3% will be slightly bigger until it gains/looses its way to 1000% profits (where its at now)

as mentioned, it sells in 72 hours regardless of the price structure, it just happens to be in the positive 65% of the time

edit: i just did the math, something making 3% returns on average per trade would only need about 80 trades to 10x the innitial investment and another 80 to 10x that (thats assuming 3% every trade, some lower it some raise it higher)",t3_lws3f0,2021-03-04 07:18:10,2021-03-04

But I believe there's a reason most of us get excited at the new ATHs, because ultimately, the fiat gains are hard to ignore. And if you think about it, why should we ignore them? What do you think is the hope and motive for all the people following market cycles and clamoring for stock-to-flow models to come to fruition? Say it hits 280k this year. Then what? You think the majority of bitcoiners are just going to keep holding at that point, willing to risk it dropping 80% after hitting that target? Some will, but not the majority. Which necessitates the drop.

And that's why I've set up stop-losses.

I don't want to be caught with my hands in my pockets again, like in 2018. So stuck in the euphoria that I'm never ready to exit. And none of this has anything to do with investing money I couldn't afford to lose. I got in early enough for that not to be a factor. I can also afford to not sell for any profit right now; I'll be just fine financially if it all goes to zero tomorrow.

What it has to do with is simply wanting to *retain* the profit many of us are currently in.

Just for example, say you're up 1500%, and you set up some stop losses at 20% less than what bitcoin is currently valued at. It triggers in your sleep tonight. You wake up, kind of relieved, but then you notice the price isn't tanking anymore. This wasn't the crash. It starts going back up. Ok, if you don't want to **miss the train**, and you really believe in this thing, then you've laddered some purchases to get back on board as it climbs higher.

Will you lose some bitcoin in the process? Sure. But losing a small percentage of those unrealized profits by quickly buying back in, is a small price to pay in order to *keep* potentially over 1000% gains. Because if you were right, and did happen to sell during ""the"" crash, then guess what. You're now in a position to do a number of things including using the money to buy that much more bitcoin, buy your mom a car, or whatever. But at least you won't be pissed off waiting potentially years for the next cycle to come around, wondering why you didn't take some off the top.",t3_lx18hc,2021-03-04 05:45:31,2021-03-04

Say you had bought $100,000 worth last March when it was $5,000 since you’re so smart and now that you’ve 10x’d you want to cash out. You had 20 BTC, but now you have $1,000,000. Long term capital gains tax is 20%, so you in fact have $800,000, or 16 BTC at the 10x price of $50,000/BTC.

Now you want to get your bitcoin back but also have some cash flow. Let’s say you buy into a business that produces a 10% annual return.

$800,000 x 10% = $80,000 or 1.6 BTC per year (@ $50k). In order to get back to 20 BTC, you would have to wait 12.5 years. Do you honestly think you would be able to get back that 20 BTC over 12.5 years? Not a chance.

I think one version of the S2F will eventually become a reality, I just don't know when. And I think the people who doubt it are just blinded by the virtual aspect of bitcoin. But I've played way too many online games where virtual currencies had a very real demand and fiat-valuation to fall into that trap.

Either way that's why I have no qualms about buying back more expensive bitcoin if my laddered stop-losses are triggered.

3208,gpmtix3,t1_gpmjsy4,"Taking profits doesn't mean you have to sell all your bitcoin. Imagine for a moment that the current market cycle tops at 300k and then retraces back to say 70% of that for 90k. Just setup your sells as follows:

sell 10% at 100k
sell 20% at 160k
sell 30% at 220k
sell 40% at 280k

Your average sell price will be 220k if we even make it to 300k and you can buy back at 90k with over 100% profit in bitcoin. If we don't make it to 300k but instead only make it to say 200k you would have still taken some profits (30% with an average of 140k) that you can invest again in the bear market where the price would reach 60k.

Mind you this is with overestimating the market top for this cycle and underestimating the bear market drop. I don't think we will make it to 300k this market cycle and I think we will drop by more than 70% afterwards. But this way you will not be left out to dry if I am wrong.

Well we're on the same page as far as DCA is concerned. It's a myth. But so is maximizing profits by buying at the right time. Sure you can get lucky, but you have just as much of a chance of buying at the wrong time, right before the dip.

I take an approach of assuming that *no one* knows what will happen in the short term. But that we *can* identify an under-valued asset. Therefore the best move with something like Bitcoin is, get in as early as you can, and never sell.
