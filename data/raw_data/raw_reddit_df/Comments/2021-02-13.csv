Edi:. I also don't think the market is whack right now.  A new breed of investors has entered the scene and they just don't care about the same investment metrics that wall street does.  They're much more speculative and trend driven, they're laser focused on specific stocks as opposed to diversifying, and they use more leveraged tools like options.

I’m the one who accepted the transaction so I don’t know why your so upset at me blaming someone? But yeah I was surprised at how much it was. 

This is just the experience of someone who got some btc, put it in a common wallet, and tried to send it for payment to a vendor. I put the transaction in my wallet and that’s what it said the fee was. I had an option for a low priority transaction that had $7 fee, but it warned me it could take an extremely long time. If there is some way I could have done this transaction significantly cheaper I’d love to know what it is. I just did this one as a fun test, but if $7 is as low as it gets I wouldn’t transact in Bitcoin anymore for things like that.",t3_lijfca,2021-02-13 09:56:53,2021-02-13

Third: there are better cryptos to use as s currency, specially cryptos that can do smart contracts, can interact with differ Blockchains, etc...

Forth: BTC is the same as gold, a currency that became  an asset

Fifth: people only hodl BTC and don't use it to purchase things unless is other cryptos or other investment

Sixth: there are a few millionaire and billionaires that are heavily investing in BTC, hence the increase of value, so what do you think if BTC became a global currency, who would benefit more ?

Seventh:  if BTC is going to be used as currency why everyone is hodling instead of spending it, I mean s currency is something we use as tool for trade, an asset is something we use to hold value.

2. This point is very dumb and betrays your lack of understanding of elementary division and divisibility.
3. Also very dumb. In 10+ years, Bitcoin has had zero competition from altcoins. They are merely dead weight and attempts to part money from fools in the form of buzz words and trash talk.
4. Bitcoin is not the same as gold. False and dumb.
5. Also totally false and ignorant of how people use bitcoin.
6. Invalid point. Early investors are rewarded for taking on risk when few others would. That's why early investors in Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, etc., have all been so successful. This is not unfair.
7. Not everybody is holding instead of spending. But there are many who think that Bitcoin is still very undervalued, hence there are very few products that offer enough value to persuade them to exchange for their bitcoin. This is how supply and demand works.

You made 7 outdated, inaccurate and/or outright false points. Literally nothing you said is accurate. Of course, nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin.

I figured for this test I didn't care that much and just wanted it to go through. Good to know for less timely transactions I can set much lower and it will still eventually go through in a few days. 

Looking at this page I guess that checks out. Current going rate for 1 hour transaction is 88 sat/byte or $10.62 according to them, and they spiked up way higher in the last couple days (19 sat/byte on 2/10).

1543,gn4u14r,t1_gn4t184,"Yeah, wallets usually overshoot the fee a bit, for some reason.

Personally I think the best tool to have an idea of what fee to use is this website:
https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,4d

It doesn't suggest anything, it just hits you in the face with the data about how many unconfirmed transactions are using what fees.

Navigation is really bad, but I don't know a website that conveys the same info with a better UX.

For future reference, the Electrum wallet has a really neat fee estimator that you can set to see how far from the ""tip"" of the mempool your transaction would be. It could show like 0.5mb from the tip, or 3mb from the tip, and so on, depending on the fee you set. Of course, there will be other people making other transactions in the meantime, so it's not always guaranteed. You can check what I'm talking about [in this link](https://mempool.space/).

This way, if you set a fee high enough to be within like 1mb from the tip, there is a big chance your transaction will be included in the next block. Other than that, you can check how transactions are eaten up throughout the day in the first link I sent you, so you can set your fee depending on how much time you have to spare.",t3_lijfca,2021-02-13 11:11:36,2021-02-13

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

For the periodic selling and buying of cryptocurrencies in the Czech Republic, taxes are calculated on the basis of the difference between spendings for the purchase and income from selling cryptocurrencies. The tax rate applied in this case is 15% and can be compared to trades using foreign currencies.The same procedure applies when receiving payments in cryptocurrencies where the base is calculated this way too: Tax base = Income in CZK from selling cryptocurrencies + Value of cryptocurrencies (indicated in CZK) — Expenses in CZK.",t3_lin1e4,2021-02-13 19:53:52,2021-02-13

1898,gn5mukl,t1_gn4r1nl,"Here’s what I found:

>	Cryptocurrency trading and mining is typically treated as property and taxed as capital gains in the Netherlands. Unlike other countries that tax crypto as property, however, the cost basis can only be carried back to January 1st of the given tax year, and it resets again each tax year on January 1st.
This means you have tax on gains or losses based on the change in value over the year.
If you buy crypto during the tax year, you are taxed on any gains it makes between the time of acquisition and at the end of the tax year (on January 1st). 
If you hold crypto through the tax year, you are taxed on any gains it makes from beginning of the year to the end of the year. 

Essentially, it’s just a capital gains tax and you‘re taxed only on your gains (and not your investment + your gains) based on how well the asset performed.

The tax brackets are super generous, compared to other EU countries tbh

You can search eBay for virtual coins. They sell right for what you’d expect, $50 to $55 thousand at this moment in time.  The most important thing with these coins is that you have to ensure they are still funded - not scratched/hologram removed.  

The real reason why these coins suck is almost all of them are just plastic with a bitcoin logo and a wallet address. They’re unfunded.  And often the keys are printed on the coins; the wallet addresses are monitored by scammers so anytime anyone ever funds a wallet, they remove it because THE KEYS ARE PRINTED ON THE COINS FOR ANYONE TO COPY.

2624,gn2of8k,t3_lia0ns,"I believe that we are at a very interesting point of time, where big corporations, wealthy people, investment banks etc. are eyeing cryptocurrency, - as an asset, as a speculative investment.

It's really sad, because that's not what this is all about!

But it's also great. Especially more people will learn about Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies. That again have a dark side - Some of them will make 'YOLO casino-investments' and some might be rich fast. But in the long run, it will probably make as many poor as it makes rich.  
But also a bright side. People will learn about crypto. Young computergeeks, mathgeeks etc. And they will improve and make new innovation. We are still in the beginning. And even Cardano is most likely not a perfect platform and in the end a lot of things have to happend. Probably we will have newer platforms that will be better for some generations to come. Not people-generations, but like Bitcoin is Blockchain 1.0, Etherium and a lot of others including Cardano is Blockchain 2.0. Some will say that DAG-coins and other very very high transaction coins are Blockchain 3.0, which might be a bit ironic, since they are not actually using a blockchain.

I think that a lot of things are changing now. In 'the cryptoworld' especially, but also in 'the real world'. The role of banks is up for discussion! I would never have thought that it would be 'this easy'. In a lot of countries it's not. India is a good example. But right now in America, it seems that cryptocurrency and especially Bitcoin is totally accepted and mainstream and fine.

I was certain that many countries, including the US, Canada, Europe, South Korea, Japan and other 1st world countries would make it illegal, or at least try. And the game is not over yet! It very well still might happend! But as more big corporations, states, universities, well known individuals like Elon Musk etc, are known to hold Bitcoin, it's getting harder to outlaw it. But then again. Gold was confiscated and made illegal in the US., - so everything can happend!

Also I think that right now there is a change in the perception of what cryptocurrency is. I thing that privacy coins are already being disallowed / made illegal, as well as all exchanges not requiring KYC and AML. We might see a situation where you can have, trade and use bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies, but a) Only those allowed by your government and b) Only if you tell the authorities your wallet addresses.

If you are 'all tinfoil diehard freedom-advocate' you would see this as the first step of a confiscation. And who knows. It might be. But it also might not. A tamed cryptocurrency like this will loose all of the values that 'we were promised'. Next thing could very well be that all allowed wallets will only accept to send and recieve money from whitelisted addresses/wallets. And gone were the censorship resistense, gone was the banking the unbanked etc.

I know, I have a dark mind. And hopefully this is not what is happending. But I am afraid that it might be.

Our gov systems are so corrupt and so high in taxes that the norm is to exade taxes, people just dont give a F about it, and gov is so incompetent  to find out that is an everyday thing.

Most of the stores accept cash payments, without registering the transaction. So the store  avoid paying tax on that sale, and they pay the salary to their employees on hand as well. So basically this employees now have unregisterd cash on their hand that the gov doesn't know, which they use to buy in other stores that don't register the transaction as well. And the loop is infinite.

So you basically have a huge informal way  of people earning money, and stores avoiding taxes.

You also have people who export  services: software developer, designers, etc.  They all want to get paid in cripto, for an easy way to bring the money into the country: they selll it for cash in P2P way.

Apart  from that, you have the never ending devaluating Argentinian Peso. So you basically don't want to have your saving  in pesos. And the goverment doesn't let you buy dollars. So you basically have this new way to save: cripto.

Sure, I should first clarify I'm libertarian, which, while being close to Republican, is quite open to immigration, because in a truly free and capitalist system there is very little or no welfare/handouts, meaning very little or no taxes. Illegal immigration becomes problematic when the system *does* tax for handouts which attracts others to get ""free stuff"" and abuse the system while having no care about damage since they can easily move away. This is the problem President Trump was working against. It had nothing to do with racism or ""xenophobia"". Trump was looking out for the interests of his own country first (as he should). If someone truly understands Bitcoin, they'll understand it's meant to empower libertarians, empower economic freedom, empower people to *keep* the fruits of their own labor. In that situation, immigration, whether legal or not, becomes a topic of less importance.

So, specifically for your question I'd say you're heading the right direction for two reasons. First, you seem to speak English well. That opens opportunities. I recently answered another [comment on widespread English](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lhtixp/cryptocurrency_has_become_a_worldwide_transaction/gn15n4b/?context=3). My friend worked to improve his English, and did. He worked hard, got better and better jobs and eventually became a homeowner. To accelerate his legal status I even introduced him to my sister (he was a good friend). You seem similar by having clear desire to improve your life/situation. People like that can do well anywhere, because they can attract others who are open to helping them. Yes, the U.S. is a place for opportunities but it's not the only one. Some like Canada too, for example. Again, success is more about each individual. My friend, and even some of his friends, came to America and frankly kicked the a** of many Americans because they came understanding harsh realities in life and being grateful for opportunity, compared to Americans who had become lazier and complacent, with feelings of entitlement. So, yeah, just be positive, work hard, learn about and use cryptocurrencies, which will increasingly mean easier mobility and opportunity, and try to have a game plan; then just network with others who can help you get what you want. 

If Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies do what I think, then the environment for legal immigration programs will head in a more libertarian, meaning better and more open, direction, especially in the U.S., because it will be harder to abuse a ""welfare state"" situation.",t3_lia0ns,2021-02-13 05:43:28,2021-02-13

This new monetary system would have to be overwhelmingly more powerful (like BTC is over USD) before Bitcoin would be supplanted by it. Network effects are extremely powerful, and once a technology network starts moving, it will almost certainly stay for a long time.

This is beside the point, though. Bitcoin allows for a better environmental future no matter how you look at it. 

1. Roughly 40% of the energy production used in mining Bitcoin comes from renewables (mostly hydroelectric power in southern China). 
2. The amount that doesn't comes from traditional fossil fuels, but even here the situation is nuanced. Because you can't transmit electricity over long distances without losing it in the cables, most energy production is done near high-population centers to service people's needs. This is not necessarily where energy is cheapest or most environmentally sound. What Bitcoin allows is for people to draw energy wherever in the world it is cheapest and greenest and immediately use it, on site, to mine Bitcoin (even if it is 1000 miles away from any city). So the quality of energy production used to mine Bitcoin is better on average than the energy produced to meet the needs of people.
3. Some, but not much or most, of the traditional fossil fuel energy used to mine Bitcoin is energy that would have been wasted otherwise. In oil drilling, there are always natural gas flares and leaks that are not economically viable to capture and run through pipes. Often these flares are combusted before being released into the air in order to convert the methane into CO2 (a greener solution). If you are running local mining operations, you can immediately use that energy toward mining rather than simply combusting it.

All this said, the type of energy production is independent of energy consumption. You can consume vast amounts of energy that has nothing to do with how it was made. So while there are writers and news anchors and people worried about Bitcoin's energy consumption, there is no reason that it would not follow the trend toward consuming renewable energy like we already see in other industries and applications.",t3_lia0ns,2021-02-13 01:29:29,2021-02-13

The US has more rich inventor billionaires than other countries, sure, but what matters to me is how far you can fall down the ladder of society before the government comes and helps you.

I remember in many European countries noticing a lack of homeless people. When I asked why I was told ""the only homeless people here are those who reject help because they are mentally ill. If anyone comes to the government for help we give them someone to sleep and get them back on their feet"". 

I also remember in supposedly ""socialist"" Denmark realising that people are actually better off financially on average than in the US even after huge taxes - because absolutely everything is completely free like education, healthcare, etc, and median wages are so much better.

Also, I appreciate the idea of freedoms in the US, but I think it's become a caricature. People have the freedom to carry guns, but not to live a long and healthy life  - that's what embarrasses me. In the US people seem to think only they have freedoms, but it only actually applies to guns. Lots of other countries have way more freedoms in every other aspect of life if you aren't talking about guns.

In many European countries rights are positive, meaning someone else has to provide it, while in america, many are negative, which means ""no one"" can stop you.

I agree we are at a crossroads of some kind. And it may truly be a cultural issue. For example, I dont know of anyone who moves to, say france, for a life of opportunity and freedom the way you put it. They move for maybe the perception of ease of life, benefits, local culture. It's a comfort decision.

America has a different purpose and to be honest, I beleive the net benefit of the U.S. is greater than most countries bc of that opportunity and freedom. 

And you're right, the US gov views its poor differently. And that is something a lot of people have problems with.

Also, wealth and power protects itself (which is why I think many of these wounds are gov inflicted). 

I'm 100% biased on some of this bc of where I live, but I dont see the same ingenuity and progress in many respects in other countries, outside of government programs, than we do in the US, and the Role of gov is rightfully heavily scrutinized here. For example, the progress we see in the US about other countries is almost always a gov program that helps new parents or something. That is merely a wealth redistribution. I'll hear about energy initiatives as well but I dont know who is 100% green yet and we have that goal too. Maybe their export is progressivism.

It's a fascinating topic. What are we to expect from the american gov?",t3_lia0ns,2021-02-13 22:44:57,2021-02-13
2882,gn4u0vj,t1_gn4qlli,"I appreciate you response. I'll put it this way. If someone asked you 10 years ago is america racist...heck, 20 years ago, the answer would be less racist than people deem it today. 

I believe that we are in a growth spirt  and are experience growing pains of our past and to be honest, just changing the standard of how aware we should be of each other. The systemic racism is nuanced in many respects, subtle and something we are actively analyzing and combating every day. It is an active, everyday issue. With a nation as wildly diverse as America, this is something that can be expected, but we are a land of opportunity and it's something both sides advocate for. And, of course, social media helps and huts this process.

When George Floyd died, there was an uproar based on America's reaction. Other countries began trying to address their racial issues based on our people's lead. And to be honest, it's extremely complex in America and we have our own unique history and unique history of racism. 

If I wanted to throw Australia under the bus I easily could point to the that fact it was founded under racism and the apparent deplorable treatment of Aboriginal people. I can generalize Australia but you also don't have the magnifying glass on you. The country is mostly white, and googling ""racism in australia"" is an endless series of articles. 

I agree with you more than simply defending America. I guess my point is that everywhere has racism. We are humans, we are animals who want to protect our own little worlds. There are a lot of good and plenty of awful things that come in that. I just don't buy that America is somehow the bad guy, let alone basically the only bad guy when we are actively addressing the issue. And, if we want to blame trump, well a record number of people voted against him. It's a complicated process which makes the U.S. great.

The source linked is from 2018 when the hash rate was 1/3rd of what it is now, so at the very least we need to triple the value in the chart.

The source of your chart claims (citing another course which dates back all the way to summer 2014) 183M GJ/year energy consumption.

Lets do some quick math to check out that number. 

&nbsp;


[We can look up the rough number of hashes/second on the network](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html) based on the rate blocks are found and the difficulty at the time. Lets look at the hashrate at 3 points in time.

Date | Hash rate 
:--:|:--:|:--:
Today | 150m Th/s 
Sept 2018 | 45m Th/s  
June 2014 | 0.1m Th/s 


&nbsp;


[The bitcoin wiki has a table of ASICs and their efficiency](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison) so lets look at the most efficient miner on the market today the Ebit E10 which does 11.1 Gh/J (giga hashes per joule).

If we assume that only those asics are running, and every hash is generated as energy efficiently as currently possible then we can work out the energy usage.

&nbsp;

[150m Th/s = ((150\*10\^6)\*10\^12 hashes / second) / (11.1\*10\^9 hashes / joule)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28150*10%5E6%29*10%5E12+hashes+%2F+second%29+%2F+%2811.1*10%5E9+hashes+%2F+joule%29+) = 13 \* 10\^9 J/s or, 13.51 gigawatts

Working it out for the other dates we get:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


That number in 2014 is absolutely tiny, where as the numbers today are pretty large. [The total energy produced in the US is roughtly 1.1 TW.](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php) So the energy consuption of bitcoin is about 1.3% of the power produced by the US.

However part of the explanation for the 2014 number being so tiny, is we assumed our hashes were generated with the most efficient hardware available, which is orders of magnitude better than what was available in 2014. 

[This article from spring 2014](https://medium.com/start-up-vision/bitcoin-mining-in-2014-c777a78500f6) says the top of the line mining hardware at the time was the TerraMiner IV, which is listed in our table from the bitcoin wiki as producing 1.6 Th/s with a power consumption of 2100 watts. Which works out to 0.76 Gh/s, significantly worse than todays hardware. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

If we recompute our table using this value for our 2014 number we get this.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Still much smaller than today, but also much larger than our original estimate. But the original chart gave yearly energy consuption (joules/year), not just wattage (joules/second), so to be able to directly compare we need to multiply by the number of seconds in a year = 60\*60\*24\*365 = 31536000.

This actually ends up being much closer to the chart than what I expected, but its still off by more than a factor of 2, and we were making optimal assumptions about efficiency, it true fact some people will be using less efficient hardware so the total consumption will be even higher than this, and then energy for cooling is another very significant factor that we have totally ignored. 

I don't think the original chart was made with the intent to decieve, especially because it was probably made in 2018 and is just being reposted now and the numbers were much more accurate then, but to post it today without that context seems deceptive and if you are trying to convince people who don't already support bitcoin they might become wary of your whole argument.

&nbsp;

A better argument against concerns about bitcoins energy consumption IMO is that:

It is a significant amount of energy used, but the nature of bitcoin mining means a lot of the energy is derived from renuable sources at off peak demand in order to minimize electricity costs because much more can be saved there than in increasing miner efficiency at this point, and moving forward we are starting to see ideas that use bitcoin mining as heat generate to warm spaces which is much more efficient that just running a furnace.

I think the best argument for bitcoin's energy usage is that it can A) Be used to turn ""waste"" energy into something valuable, B) Doesn't care about the energy source (and is mostly powered by renewable energy). Based on these two points one can further construct the argument that bitcoin subsidises renewable energies by giving them a use during off-peak hours. Wind turbines and nuclear run 24/7 and the excess energy is difficult to store.

Lastly, we should accept that some things are important enough to justify their environmental impact. Laptops require far more in the way of resources than typewriters, for example.",t3_lincrs,2021-02-13 16:26:32,2021-02-13

First, apart fom bitcoin being the biggest network with regards to proof of work and bitcoin being the most adopted decentralized trust exchange protocol, it isn't 'the best' in other regards. Contrary to popular believe it's not the most decentralized network (depends slightly on which metric you use to measure decentralization), it's not the most energy friendly system (I'm aware the current financial system uses much much much more energy though) and it's not the most user friendly system (e. g. high fees, long learning curve, rampant insider/wash trading, low tx latency ). While i know these are features, and not bugs, it seems naive to say: 'this is the best we can do'. Many parameters of bitcoin are prety arbitrary and that is exactly why so many alternative protocols have been developed, all with different trade-offs.

While i whole heartedly believe in bitcoin in the bitcoin v.s. FIAT debate, I'm on the side of some newer protocols with regard to the Alt v.s. Bitcoin debate.

I understand bitcoin is software and can therefore be adaptive to a changing environment, i also dont know if we can trust humans when they have to make collective decisions. The adaptivety of bitcoin hinges on the concensus and precisely therein lies the problem with bitcoin maximalism.

Lets compare it to a known legacy 'decentralized organisation' : democratic institutions. While they work and are very essential to our everyday life, we can argue that they are also very inefficient and often make very very wrong desicions. Democratic goverments wage wars, oppress ethnic groups and make genuine mistakes.

Somehow the effect you would expect by pooling the views of all voters ends up with a system that doesn't fully represent the society which it should serve. I'm afraid that if we don't redesign some of the features that make up bitcoin concensus we might end up with a similair issue: a slow and cumbersome institution that doesn't represent the interests of it's individual constituents.

When you're dealing with crypto, which is a highly volatile asset, one would prefer to not talk in amounts but rather in percentage increases/decreases. It very stressful for a hodler for other people to know what his/her net worth is. I once told a colleague of mine that I bought X amount in 2013 at usd 13 and have been buying since then. They immediately calculated how much I should have and started consulting me on what I should do with the money. Why don't you buy this and why don't you buy that? Can you give me x amount of money?
