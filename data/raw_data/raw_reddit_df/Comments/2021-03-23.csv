Don't day trade. You will be competing with market participants that are much better (more informed, access to more data, better emotional state, larger bankroll, better tech etc etc). In order to make money in trading, you have to beat your opponents, AND taxes, AND the trading fees, AND your own self (discipline).  

So you need to ask yourself: what are you doing better than the other participants in the market? If you can't answer this question clearly, you shouldn't be trading. Or if you still really want to, treat it like a gambling hobby (nothing wrong with that, but be clear that it's just gambling with negative odds for your side).  

> HODL  

You should store your coins in a proper wallet (open source, non-custodial, peer reviewed). But before that you need to understand how to backup and store it properly.

You can watch some of those videos (and/or search for ""how to choose a wallet"") on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/aantonop/search?query=private%20key

the us won't just print money. It's plan is to invest 3 trillion in the economy, because the expectation is returns on that investment higher than 3 trillion. Which isn't difficult for the us. 

It's going to raise taxes and borrow money. Considering the republicans have given the multiple trillion dollar tax cuts that haven't helped the economy at all, it won't be that difficult. 

The inflation will come from the economy heating up again. Which isnt great...but it's mostly bad for the mega rich because they're going to get they lose their money boohoo and it can't just sit there inactive getting bigger. They have to be productive again. 

Creating a productive economy is good for everyone. It is not a healthy sign how many people are invested in BTC because they want basics of life - houses, cars, medicine. No one should need to use high risk new technology investments so they can afford a place to live. People use to work minimum wage to get a house, not use complex financial instruments like half of us are forced to do.

This won't be like quantative easing or propping up bonds or any of that shit. 

There's a lot of things directly good for bitcoin as well. So clean energy initiatives, and energy efficiency drives will make energy cleaner and cheaper - good for mining.  

It's going to spend money to improve digital skills, and internet infrastructure. They're spending 400 billion on improving the internet in the us. This is vital to the long term health of digital currency, obviously!

People that have lost their jobs (mostly service industry) will be getting them back to support all the people that have been working from home, and they've had pretty decent stimulus/unemployment in the meantime. For the people staying at home, they haven't been able to travel, haven't had to pay for daycare, etc. and they'll go nuts on spending.

The federal reserve says they aren't worried about inflation, which I think is a lie. I think all the spending is going to start creating some pretty big inflation across the board (5-6%). The federal reserve will allow this to happen for 12-18 months to allow the economy to recover, and then they'll start raising interest rates (against their previous statement of keeping them low for 3 years) which will slow down the economy in order to ward off inflation.

It's changed on a regular basis to reflect spending habits. People in 1990 didn't spend money on internet, smartphones, etc. Recreation and health habits have changed too. Updating it absolutely makes sense.

Also please read what the BLS says:

>**The CPI does not necessarily measure your own experience with price change.** It is important to understand that BLS bases the market baskets and pricing procedures for the CPI-U and CPI-W populations on the experience of the relevant average household, not of any specific family or individual. For example, if you spend a larger-than-average share of your budget on medical expenses, and medical care costs are increasing more rapidly than the cost of other items in the CPI market basket, your personal rate of inflation may exceed the increase in the CPI. Conversely, if you heat your home with solar energy, and fuel prices are rising more rapidly than other items, you may experience less inflation than the general population does. **A national average reflects millions of individual price experiences; it seldom mirrors a particular consumer's experience.**

So not everyone is average, but for every person who eats more beef than chicken, there's someone who eats more chicken than beef. For someone who pays for no gym membership, there's someone who goes balls to the wall with an Equinox pass. The point is that even if you aren't perfectly captured, you can see why the basket of goods at least makes sense for many households.

>just to make sure you get my argument: the same 60m¬≤ appartment in Vienna, in 2001 was about 300‚Ç¨ ... and it is now at around 850‚Ç¨ per month,... I am certainly sure, that the wage of a cashier working in a supermarket for 15 years did not have tripled in the same time.....no?

You tell me how wages have changed in Vienna. CPI is for the US. However your analysis also has some major flaws. Just because rent triples, it doesn't mean your income needs to triple to keep up. Traditionally it's advised to keep housing costs under 33% of your gross income. That means the rest of your money goes elsewhere. When housing goes up, you only need your income to go up by that much to make up for it (for this thought experiment, let's keep other goods constant). Some goods obviously go up, and maybe not everything triples, but other things go down in cost.. so guess where we are back to? CPI or some sort of basket of goods. CPI actually takes in account for rent if you didn't realize that.

So again, picking and choosing a single item that has increased isn't reflective of actual inflation. Picking or choosing a few items that have increased isn't fair either, which is why you go with some sort of aggregate figure. If you dislike the basket of goods figures from the CPI, I suggest you create your own or explain why your basket is more fair, because most economists agree that CPI actually overstates inflation, hence the development of Chained CPI.",t3_mb1kxl,2021-03-23 13:43:42,2021-03-23
1741,grwd5gd,t1_grw5wav,"Housing costs are included in the sense that rent is included in CPI calculations. However, using house prices as an inflation calculator isn't fair either. Yes, for those who havent bought yet, there's a bigger impact, but at the same time if you have bought a house, your payments are locked in based on your purchase price and interest rate then. Your future payments are not impacted by the rise in prices, although the property tax side is affected. When you sell, you benefit from the inflated prices.

>Just because your meat and eggs have not skyrocketed , does not mean inflation is not happening. With that said, even meat is higher.

I never said inflation isn't happening. Of course it's happening. The Fed views inflation (at a manageable rate) as necessary for a healthy economy. But to use your point just because your house has skyrocketed doesn't mean inflation is out of control either. That's the concept of a basket of goods. It's so that you can't just point to housing and I can't just point to cars or TVs. Using an average basket of goods that's representative of what most people are spending on is an objective measure. It's not perfect, but it's far better than a Redditor using gut feeling or saying ""You know what, I feel like prices are high, so there MUST be 10% inflation.""",t3_mb1kxl,2021-03-23 13:31:19,2021-03-23

I would say that this is very difficult and maybe borderline impossible because the future is unpredictable, the farther away the timeline the more unpredictable it becomes.

I would consider hoarding to be when you have so much money that you can't possibly conceive of how you would spend it productively, which going back to my previous argument is hard, because you don't know if people in the future will figure a good way to spend that money.

Bear in mind that a lot of the issues in other countries that the US has dealings with are very complex, and additionally the motive for the US doing something isn't always to be the good guy - overthrowing a government to install a sympathetic figurehead is a good example of this and it's not done through charity work.

The idea behind Cryonics is not to preserve the precise electrical activity (which we know can be lost without loss of long term memories and other aspects of personal identity) but to preserve the structural information so that with future technology, they can potentially be revived.

2171,grxksuj,t1_grxiqti,"Sure. Suppose the activity of the brain takes the form of millions of strings all vibrating at different frequencies and in dependence on the vibrations of every other string, to the point that beautiful sustained harmonics and reverberations emerge.  The momentum of one string depends upon the momentum of another, and all the strings are interdependent in this manner. Then suppose you just grab all the strings with your fist and stop them dead. All the information about all the strings‚Äô relative motion has dissolved as heat into your hand. It‚Äôs now practically impossible to unscramble that information, even if you still can determine exactly the structure of the strings. 

Those vibrations are analogous to the series of neural oscillations that route information around in your brain. Once those cease, it‚Äôs not possible to get that system flowing again. It‚Äôs over. No amount of future technological advances can unscramble that information... 

Okay, unless we find a means to reverse all entropy, or rewind the flow of all information.

Quick edit: to your point about electrical cessation being consistent with preserved memories, etc, can you elaborate? An isoelectric EEG is braindeath. I don‚Äôt know of any case of anyone coming back from that. If you could provide one I would be very interested.

In one study, researchers recorded EEG under increasing concentrations of isoflurane, and at 3% iso, the EEG was flat, but at 4%, spikes they called nu complexes emerged. So isoelectric EEG just happened to be the macroscopic electrical phenomenon onto which the underlying cellular activity (which was still very much intact) happened to converge. So I suppose I would have to qualify my claim for it to be true, and to do so, I would posit that in the case of every neuron having a membrane potential of 0 mV (isoelectric down the the cellular level), braindeath would be irreversible.

The best strategy with Bitcoin is also the simplest:

1. Buy Bitcoin automatically with a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach. Many applications exist for this.
2. Program the automatic sending of these Bitcoins to your hardware wallet using one of the applications you will buy.
3. HODL Bitcoin no matter what.
4. Iterate from step 1.

    $60k/btc * 6.25 btc/block * 6 blocks/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year  

= $19.7 billion / year

That's a lot to us, but compared to most industries, this is still really small. And this seems more relevant than energy usage, after all the energy used by Bitcoin *must* be extremely cheap, meaning there are not other high value uses of that energy. 

I suppose it's worth mentioning that all this cost is paid for by Bitcoin users, but clearly that's irrelevant to people spreading the meme. What actually bothers people is that *they don't like Bitcoin* and so any amount of resources used for it are bad.

My problem in understanding them is the entire premise (my words):

>We have a virtual currency with no physical backing/presence of any kind, based on guessing random block hashes (gambling against other people, essentially), that most places don't accept as a form of payment, all while spending huge amounts of electricity, and only creating value while other people see increasing value.

I see claims that most energy is produced via renewable resources.  That's very dependent on where you live.  Many places still use coal power plants.

Even if 100% of the energy came from renewables, mining for cryptocurrencies still wastes a TON of energy through heat dissipation and less-than-100%-efficient electrical systems.  If you build a server farm to mine BTC, for example, this still generates heat in your house.  Your cooling bills go up in the summer.  Now, imagine this on a much-larger scale, where millions of people are generating a ton of heat while mining for cryptocurrency.  This still places larger demands on the power grid, which pushes for earlier upgrades or new equipment to keep up with demands that aren't really necessary.  Until power grids catch up, you end up with brownouts and other issues.

So...  is BTC valuable?  Yes, obviously.  But it's only valuable because people say it's valuable.  But, why is it valuable?  There's no inherent/intrinsic value in owning a block in the chain.  It can't do anything on its own, and you can't do anything with that data except buy/sell it to other people using conventional currency.  Once the fad dies down, and once the blocks are mostly mined (making it harder and harder to mine the few that are left), I won't be surprised if BTC drops significantly because there's no drive to mine for more of it due to the poor ROI.

I get wanting to have a decentralized/universal currency.  But having no physical backing behind them seems weird to me.  Having no real, tangible assets or purpose seems weird to me.  At least most countries' currencies have (in theory) some form of physical item to back their value, such as gold, which has inherent value in various forms.  If you want, you can still trade the actual gold because it's a useful substance.  It's no different than having collateral for a loan.  Crypto has nothing behind it but a block; a virtual piece of data, that has zero meaning outside of the blockchain.  And owning this block of data means nothing unless other people say it has value.  The logic is circular and confusing to me.",t3_mamwku,2021-03-23 01:50:36,2021-03-23
2457,gru3qz7,t3_mamwku,"Back of the envelope calculation: bitcoin consumes about 100TWh/y (found between 130 and 80TWh/y, plug in the number you believe).

Diesel has 11kWh/L. Ignoring engine efficiency, bitcoin equals very roughly 10GL/y of diesel.

Canada consumes about 70 000 000 L diesel per day. That includes all mining, transportation,... the whole thing. That's 25,55 GL/y.

You could run all diesel power equipment in Canada for ~4 months per 1 year of bitcoin. My educated guess is most of Canada's diesel will not be burned in mines. And I would guess worldwide gold mining is less than the total consumption of diesel in Canada.",t3_mamwku,2021-03-23 01:52:50,2021-03-23

Consuming as much electricity as entire nations for a paltry 5 transactions / second is asinine.

Putting the haters aside, a lot of folks within the blockchain and crypto community have clearly seen the issue with these inefficiencies and have/are trying to address it through other mechanisms such as proof of stake etc etc. In addition, climate change is a huge issue that's on the forefront of a lot of government agendas right now.

I'd also question using a dollar amount to quantify the amount of energy used by Bitcoin as the dollar's purchasing power varies between countries. Perhaps $19.7B does not seem like a lot in the States, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not a lot globally.

It's also worth mentioning that there is no cap on Bitcoin's price, really. So your figure is not capped, and will grow as Bitcoin's price grows. 1 year ago your estimate would have been \~$1.8B.

Finally, there's the question of externalities. The true cost of energy used is not just the amount is costs to purchase it, you also have to add in the total cost to society associated acquiring and using that energy (e.g. climate change).

Imagine a coin where you proved work by idling a car engine in order to look for a particular combination of molecules in the exhaust, and you were awarded a coin whenever you found the right combination. You'd have millions of people sitting around idling their cars for no reason other than to look for the right molecule combination in their exhaust, consuming oceans of gasoline doing so. Surely that feels wasteful? But that's the same idea behind Bitcoin - sure, the scale is much different, but if the question isn't ""how wasteful is it by design"" but rather ""is it wasteful by design"", I think it's pretty clear that it is wasteful.

Why would we think a global uncensorable peer-to-peer network of electronic cash could be run cheaply?

The block reward as the source of inflation is also key for wider Bitcoin adoption. If you pre-mine the coin and then only reward miners with transaction fees, it's infinitely harder to get broad adoption.

I also wrote [a post a few years back](https://postlibertarian.com/2018/11/21/bitcoin-and-energy-everything-is-actually-ok/) reiterating similar points perhaps in a slightly more approachable format (both are long though). 

I think you should define what you mean by ""wasteful"". You specifically mentioned proof-of-stake as something that isn't wasteful, and I have basically never heard of a good argument why this would be true. Proof of stake has the exact same costs as proof of work, assuming you keep the block reward the same. 

In both cases you are holding an auction for the block reward, and people will burn resources until, in expectation, their expected share of the block reward equals their expected resource loss. In mining, this is done by sinking resources into mining equipment and electricity. In PoS, it's done by foregoing liquidity and returns by locking up your coins. Since PoS is less risky than PoW (you get your stake back, but you have to pay for mining equipment up front), then PoS results in much more resources being locked up relative to PoW, but with a smaller return per resource invested. Ergo, the expected foregone opportunity cost of the risk-adjusted investment in either case is exactly the same--it's the block reward.

Because why would we see a reduction? The number of blocks being mined will not change no matter how many transactions there are.

The point is that Bitcoin can handle being the main mode of currency without its current energy usage increasing a whole lot. This puts it in a FAR better place than any legacy alternative. Bitcoin's energy usage is MASSIVELY overblown. High estimates place Bitcoin at ~1/5th of Online Video. Some as low as <1/10th (0.2% vs 2.5%).

Bitcoin doesn't need to reduce its energy usage to be sustainable. So long as its energy usage does not scale linearly with its adoption, and so long as renewable energy exists, it needs only to be mined via renewable energy to be sustainable.

Your fundamental misunderstanding is conflating mining energy usage with Bitcoin as a whole. Your misunderstanding is imagining Bitcoin's energy usage to be much more significant than it actually is. Your misunderstanding is believing that energy usage = environmental damage.

Bitcoin does not need to change to be sustainable. At all. We don't currently have any good figures for what percentage of mining is done using renewable energy, but market forces would suggest it's a significant chunk and, as renewable energy gets cheaper, this will naturally grow.

You are asserting that right now, Bitcoin is bad for the environment. There is NO data to support this. You are asserting that we need to actively do something to lessen Bitcoin's environmental impact. There is NO data to support this.

To be *totally* fucking clear:

Bitcoin's current energy usage is not unsustainable.

Bitcoin's energy usage will not scale anywhere near linearly. It will likely never surpass other, less useful energy sinks like online video.

Adoption of Bitcoin displaces precious metals and fiat, reducing their environmental impact. Their imact is MASSIVE. Even without the majority of Bitcoin mining being done on renewables, a transition from gold + fiat would be a gain for the environment.

And on top of all of that, energy usage only matters in the context of dirty energy. Coal, gas and oil can be transported. Renewable energy cannot be transported. Energy surplus is therefore driven largely by renewable energy. Bitcoin miners seek to maximize their profits. They must mine in areas with cheap electricity. Cheap electricity comes from energy surplus. Research about WHAT energy miners are using is limited, because it's much harder to study than multiplying a few numbers together. Emissions estimates are based PURELY on the assumption that Bitcoin uses mostly dirty energy (taking electricity usage, and multiplying it by either worst-case 100% dirty energy, or averages for whichever country the 'researcher' (read: mostly just bloggers) decides to pick). The research that DOES exist, however, has placed current renewable usage as high as 80%. This sort of number just so happens to line up with basic fucking logic.

> As it is, bitcoin is unsustainable. That is a fact. 

No. This is patently false. Current estimates routinely place Bitcoin's energy consumption at less than 1/10th of Online video, or 0.2% of global energy usage. This is *not* very much for a system which is capable of replacing gold and fiat currency.

> It uses energy and creates carbon emissions.

So does fucking everything. But energy usage != carbon emissions.

The question is, just how bad is Bitcoin re ACTUAL environmental impact?

The only figures we've seen so far for researched estimates on Bitcoin's renewable/dirty energy split are in the 50-80% renewable range. Why? Because Bitcoin can be mined anywhere. It will *always* be mined mostly in places with cheap energy. Those places will always be places with energy surplus.

You can transport oil, coal and gas. They're not contributing to localized energy surplus.

If Bitcoin replaces gold and fiat, or even just significantly reduces their usage, it is a win for the environment. Period.

This is even without increasing the renewable energy share in mining... Which will happen naturally as renewables become cheaper and more wide-spread.

One more time:

> don't think people are doing as much math as you think they are, people just look at current energy usage. No predictions of it rising or falling. 

Bitcoin's current energy usage is massively overblown when you compare it to any other global energy sink. The environmental impact of that energy usage is massively overblown.

If people are looking at Bitcoin's current energy usage and convincing themselves that Bitcoin is unsustainable, those people are idiots.

Now, if Bitcoin's energy usage were to absolutely balloon, sure, it'd be worth looking at.

It's not so much about how much equipment you have as it about what kind equipment you have. Bitcoin mining has been taken over by ASICs which are very efficient (hashes/watt) and are very powerful (hashes/minute). You could have a warehouse full of GPUs using a huge amount of electricity and make orders of magnitude less Bitcoin than someone with a handful of ASICs. The reason you see huge farms is that buying ASICs 1 or 2 or even 10 at a time is cost prohibitive. As for price, in today's landscape electricity cost is pretty much irrelevant because Bitcoin is worth so much. 

>reason RIOT is based in the middle of bumblefuck upstate NY, the cheap Canadian hydropower.

When the price of Bitcoin crashes and electricity usage become limiting factor again miner will continue to seek out the cheapest possible power and as you've noted that cheap power is often environmentally sound like hydro power.

3437,grw1td3,t1_grw07lb,"I've had success using all 3 services, but Nexo is my personal favorite for ease of use reasons. Using a free-tier crypto.com debt card, you can decide to take out a loan in stablecoin against the value of your BTC in your Nexo account, and have it withdrawable as cash at an ATM, or spendable anywhere that accepts Visa within 15 - 20 minutes.

Or you can withdraw the funds to your account (but this takes longer if your bank is slow). Another nice thing about Nexo is that if you hold multiple coins (say PaxGold, which is pegged to the value of gold) their values all pool together if you want to take out a loan against any of it. And you can fairly easily decide *which* of your coins are locked in as collateral, and which stay in your 'savings account' earning interest payouts.

You can find some decent discussion on the practice in this thread:

Look at SoftBank‚Äôs NASDAQ manipulation. It was uncovered around September 2020. They had huge investments in Faang. They bought great amounts of derivatives, creating a wave. They cashed big time. And Nasdaq is much more complicated to manipulate than BTC. 

Every time I write about BTC price manipulation there‚Äôs a bunch of people commenting on how I‚Äôm looking for reasons in a chaotic system. But it is a public fact that big players can and do manipulate the stock market. How would one ignore the fact BTC is the best possible target for a market manipulation.

So my tinfoil hat two cents are that the plug was pulled. Statistically the market was up for a correction. Why now? Why like this? Because some big boy is making their move. 

I for one would feel better if it does not tank too much. Everything under 50k will make me nervous. Let‚Äôs hope there is real buying power at these levels.",t3_mayw9h,2021-03-23 13:41:06,2021-03-23
