Neither of these are likely and as established you can't stop it and you dont want to trigger the creation of an underground marketplace that isnt taxed or let competitor nations get the upperhand.

If the US recognises the value of bitcoin as an innovation and realises they can't just make a copy they can cheat with then the logical conclusion they'll incrementally have to accept bitcoin. Which this interview indicates will be the likely position the US takes. She seems very well read though on the topic to my knowledge and I dont necessarily understand how far up she is alongside whoever makes the big decisions, but it would seem the US will be bullish on bitcoin.",t3_mor4lo,2021-04-11 22:52:30,2021-04-11

For those curious I‚Äôm from Argentina, and that‚Äôs my personal gaming pc (were I also work, edit photos and mix some music) that I‚Äôve built a few years ago.

It‚Äôs running a GTX 1080 and a 1 gen Ryzen 5 1600, so you can calculate how old is my rig ;) 

With Btc prices so high (and climbing) I‚Äôve decided to give it a shot at mining as I already have the hardware that I‚Äôve pay for it, and the electricity here in Argentina it‚Äôs quite cheap (also winter is coming so...)

As you may now Argentina‚Äôs currency is really devalued compare to the USD so the forex really helps.
