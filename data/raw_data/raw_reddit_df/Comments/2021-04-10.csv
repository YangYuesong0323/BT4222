928,gu13u2z,t1_gu0zy20,"Yes you are right. If I sell for $100 and you buy for $100 then the two orders cancel each other out as they become a completed transaction.

However, what happens is I might start by saying I will sell at (no less than) $105 and you say you'll buy at (no more than) $95. Our orders can't cancel out yet because we can't agree on price. That's why there are so many orders in the video in that list that haven't yet cancelled out. These are called the orders on the book.

At that point, either I need to lower my sell price, you need to raise your buy price, or we wait for another person to come along to agree with either of our prices.

Now suddenly, if lots of people who also want to buy at no more than your price of $95, well naturally they will try to outbid each other to get their orders in first. Maybe one guy says $96 and another $97, etc. Eventually someone will take up my offer for $105.

There could be a HUGE number of people offering to sell at $105, so until enough people eat through all the coins selling at $105 then the price will never increase to $106. That's what happened in the video.

I wish you would have scaled in. By scaling in, you could have kept some powder dry for 50K or 40K or even 30K if we (I hope not) revisit them.   You chose a riskier way, but to the risk takers goes the rewards, so you're not wrong.

But you wanted to go all in, so you must have strong hands now.  Do not sell for a loss.  Yes you could theoretically lose it all, but it's far, far, more likely you'll not lose a dime if you're patient.

You might cross a desert or two in the near to mid term, and watching your USD balance cut in half is not for the faint of heart.  But you're a hodler now, there is no sell button on your computer, not at a loss there isn't.

DCA basically says it is better to invest in the future than the present (i.e. prices are falling) but since the future never arrives is it ever a good time to invest?

Also, the logical conclusion of DCA is that once the full amount of bitcoin has been bought you should sell it all and repeat the DCA process. Does anyone ever do that?",t3_mo07a5,2021-04-10 17:50:41,2021-04-10

"" Knowledge of the Fibonacci sequence was expressed as early as [Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala) (c.¬†450¬†BC‚Äì200¬†BC). Singh cites Pingala's cryptic formula *misrau cha* (""the two are mixed"") and scholars who interpret it in context as saying that the number of patterns for *m* beats (*Fm*\+1) is obtained by adding one \[S\] to the *Fm* cases and one \[L\] to the *Fm*‚àí1 cases.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#cite_note-12) [Bharata Muni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Muni) also expresses knowledge of the sequence in the [*Natya Shastra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natya_Shastra) (c.¬†100¬†BC‚Äìc.¬†350¬†AD).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#cite_note-13)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#cite_note-GlobalScience-7) However, the clearest exposition of the sequence arises in the work of [Virahanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virahanka) (c.¬†700 AD), whose own work is lost, but is available in a quotation by Gopala (c.¬†1135):[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#cite_note-FOOTNOTELivio2003197-11) ""
