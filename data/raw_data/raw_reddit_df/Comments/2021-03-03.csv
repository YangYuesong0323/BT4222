80,gpfxg54,t1_gpel4q1,"Good question. I've written about it previously here:

https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964#how-are-coinswap-and-lightning-network-different

The gist is that CoinSwap is fundamentally an on-chain technology while Lightning is off-chain. Bitcoin needs on-chain privacy as well, otherwise the bad privacy can leak into layer-2 solutions. That also means CoinSwap is better for larger amounts while LN is better for smaller amounts. Also CoinSwap is likely to have stronger sybil resistance than LN.",t3_lm6nmk,2021-03-03 02:29:51,2021-03-03

That was CoinJoin not CoinSwap. And yes I agree it bad, hopefully CoinSwap will be much harder to block because its very un-obvious that a given transaction is or isnt a CoinSwap. CoinJoin's by contrast as much more obvious, and so surveillance companies easily detect them and rate them as ""higher risk"".",t3_lm6nmk,2021-03-03 07:08:54,2021-03-03

Like, if you buy 1 coin for $1, then sell when it's worth $10, you'd need to use that $10 to invest in other things which net you $100 value before that one coin just rises to the value of $100 naturally- otherwise you're just converting currency for no reason.

For most anynoe, the simple algorithm of

*buy at year 0, never sell*

is going to make you much more money than buying every dip and selling every peak.
