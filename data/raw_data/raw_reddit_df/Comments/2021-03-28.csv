99,gskasde,t3_mev0am,"Something I’ve wanted to bring to the attention of this sub for a while is an obscure yet useful piece of tax rule for U.K. owners of Bitcoin.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals


> “Losing public and private keys
If an individual misplaces their private key (for example throwing away the piece of paper it is printed on), they will not be able to access the cryptoasset. The private key still exists as part of the cryptography, albeit it is not known to the owner any more. Similarly the cryptoassets will still exist in the distributed ledger. This means that misplacing the key does not count as a disposal for Capital Gains Tax purposes. More information can be found in the HMRC Capital Gains manual (CG13155).

> If it can be shown there is no prospect of recovering the private key or accessing the cryptoassets held in the corresponding wallet, a negligible value claim could be made. If HMRC accepts the negligible value claim, the individual will be treated as having disposed of and re-acquiring the cryptoassets they cannot access so that they can crystallise a loss.”

I might make a full post for this at some point but for now I’m still getting my head around it. Effectively, this gives lost wallets value. If you can prove that you lost a wallet worth £x you can use that to write off a tax bill.

So, and bear with me here, if you were able to prove it, then would you be able to sell the rights of that wallet to an individual wishing to write off a tax bill?",t3_mev0am,2021-03-28 16:19:37,2021-03-28

If it dips, you will either wait for it to dip more which might never happend or be like""this is the end we are going to 0 now"".

If it pumps then it is too expensive.

You can´t trust random redditors to know where/when put your money in. 

What you **need** is to read about it, research as much info as you can so you can decide if it is a good investment or not. 

my opinion? a BTC is very cheap still it makes no sense lol. To me people who doesnt buy bitcoin just hate money. We are just 3 halvings into the game. 

So just DCA. 200$ week?, 500$?, 50$? whatever you feel confortable with.  You need to forget about that money for the next 5 years at least. Longer the better. When dips put more it to low your average. That simple.

As time goes and the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, it would cost you less and less Bitcoin to make those $800 payments each month.

927,gskb0ak,t3_meudvg,I have question. By how much percentage does bitcoin have to increase by in order for you guys to not worry when shit hits the fan. $1400 stimulus all put into bitcoin might not sound much given the time period of investment. I am from South Africa and we have something similar which has been in effect since last year May until now April when it expires. 35 dollars a month more or less but only for the unemployed. Its something atleast but yes your stimulus package is our countries national average household income salary. There will be no poverty for a period of time in country. Obviously your guys cost of living is much higher than ours. It was just a thought though as the cost of living could increase by some margin every quarter. Bitcoin investment is going to be a rollercoaster of a ride to the top. Many people may not be able to hold that long because of patience and financial pressure.As they would need that money to cope. Also major adoption of crypto in the majors sectors is still going to take time.So how much and how long is also something I forgot as well is needed if a scenario of such sort would occur if all hell breaks lose in your country.,t3_meudvg,2021-03-28 16:23:15,2021-03-28

I always wondered why people who seemed to be so morally opposed to the debasement of the currency are so in favor of redirecting all that money to the crypto markets. It's obviously because they only care about increasing their own profits. Hyperinflation never has to happen as long as it's a believable potential threat and stimulus is always seen as bullish and positive as at least a portion of it is being used to pump BTC. As a holder of BTC because I believe in the technology and the new possibilities it provides, I wish there were more nuanced takes on this than the usual fodder in these subreddits. 

I'm not saying inflation is not a real potential threat, but I am curious why all previous bailouts after the financial crisis in 2008 didn't result in hyperinflation, and why these new stimulus packages definitely will.   Why a certain obscene amount of money printing doesn't lead to that result but once it reaches a certain number it definitely does.
