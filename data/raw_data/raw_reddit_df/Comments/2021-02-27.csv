I'm a little nervous about regulation on the medium term horizon and one of the scenarios I've considered is that on/off ramps would be pressured to only deal with currency that had ""clear title"" for lack of a better term.

Said differently, if you went to cash out 1 BTC and it had only ever gone from Exchange > Your Wallet > Back to Exchange they'd let you through and you'd be all set.

However, if in the recent X number of transactions there had been a coinjoin / coinswap they would assume the funds are ""guilty"" and not allow them to be exchanged.

I hope I'm being overly paranoid, but that is one reason I've avoided any kind of obfuscating transactions.  Read up on Civil Asset Forfeiture if you need to reinforce your distrust of how personal property can be considered ""guilty.""

For those that don't know, here is a section in the JoinMarket docs: https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/tumblerguide.md#a-note-on-fees

CoinSwap uses much less block space for the same amount of privacy than CoinJoin, and therefore would cost less in miner fees.

51,govggtr,t1_gouzjzh,"> How does taproot affect CoinSwap?

Taproot benefits CoinSwap slightly because taproot allows for scriptless scripts which improves the privacy of the backout case where the HTLCs have to be broadcast on-chain. Also if taproot became very popularly used on-chain then CoinSwap could use schnorr signatures instead of ecdsa-2p to create the multisig addresses, and that would make it easier to test and review.

> Is it technically possible to do a coin swap and have the output of that be the opening of a lightning channel? Is there any way that coin swap benefits lightning Network?

Yes that's very possible.

CoinSwap would help with Lightning Network's privacy because many privacy attacks against LN work by using information obtained from the blockchain to analyze lightning channels and payments. Because CoinSwap improves on-chain privacy this would become harder.",t3_lm6nmk,2021-02-27 03:42:07,2021-02-27
52,govh1hk,t1_gov8xsp,"> How easy is it to add up every pair/triplet of outputs in the block chain over a few blocks to correlate input to spends?

Pretty easy, but the trouble is you get many many false positives doing this. Especially if you code CoinSwap to make use of amounts which are already common on the blockchain (for example 0.01 btc, or $50 in btc). And the user can easily increase the number of false positives just by waiting longer between the coinswap transactions (which doesn't cost them any miner fees, it only costs them in time).

> How far separated will most coinswaps be?

There's no limit, it just depends on how long users are willing to wait. As for what the default will be, I don't know. Soon I hope to do some more detailed analyse to see what kind of anonymity set is obtained by waiting for different amounts, so the default could be set based on that.",t3_lm6nmk,2021-02-27 03:44:52,2021-02-27

55,govjjbh,t1_goucwei,"Yes it's similar to CoinJoins because it's a privacy protocol where the user always holds their own private keys. It's better than Equal-Output-CoinJoin (the kind created by JoinMarket, Wasabi and Samourai) for a few reasons:

* Cheaper miner fees because less block space is needed for the same amount of privacy.

* CoinSwaps can be made to look just like regular transactions which greatly improves privacy because the anonymity set is almost every other transactions out there, rather than just the other users in your CoinJoin.

* CoinSwaps looking like regular transactions mean they improve privacy even of people who don't use CoinSwap. The additional doubt is added to every transaction.

In fact this CoinSwap project actually does combine it with CoinJoin, in the form of PayJoin: https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964#payjoin-with-coinswap",t3_lm6nmk,2021-02-27 03:56:42,2021-02-27

If someone was afraid of theft it seems like they would be trading bitcoins anonymously, not leaking any privacy-relevant information and keeping the bitcoins very secure perhaps with encryption and multisig.

60,gowzcpp,t1_gowxgsg,"That's a good question.

Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin: if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of stolen coins they won't accept coins derived from, you must carefully check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that fail. Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various authorities because in that world we'd all not like to get stuck with bad coins. This adds friction, transactional costs and allows the blacklist provider to engage in censorship, and so makes Bitcoin less valuable as a money.

Financial privacy is an essential criteria for the efficient operation of a free market: if you run a business, you cannot effectively set prices if your suppliers and customers can see all your transactions against your will. You cannot compete effectively if your competition is tracking your sales. Individually your informational leverage is lost in your private dealings if you don't have privacy over your accounts: if you pay your landlord in Bitcoin without enough privacy in place, your landlord will see when you've received a pay raise and can hit you up for more rent.

Financial privacy is essential for personal safety: if thieves can see your spending, income, and holdings, they can use that information to target and exploit you. Without privacy malicious parties have more ability to steal your identity, snatch your large purchases off your doorstep, or impersonate businesses you transact with towards you... they can tell exactly how much to try to scam you for.

Financial privacy is essential for human dignity: no one wants the snotty barista at the coffee shop or their nosy neighbors commenting on their income or spending habits. No one wants their baby-crazy in-laws asking why they're buying contraception (or sex toys). Your employer has no business knowing what church you donate to. Only in a perfectly enlightened discrimination free world where no one has undue authority over anyone else could we retain our dignity and make our lawful transactions freely without self-censorship if we don't have privacy.

Most importantly, financial privacy isn't incompatible with things like law enforcement or transparency. You can always keep records, be ordered (or volunteer) to provide them to whomever, have judges hold against your interest when you can't produce records (as is the case today). None of this requires _globally_ visible public records.

Globally visible public records in finance are completely unheard-of. They are undesirable and arguably intolerable. The Bitcoin whitepaper made a promise of how we could get around the visibility of the ledger with pseudonymous addresses, but the ecosystem has broken that promise in a bunch of places and we ought to fix it. Bitcoin could have coded your name or IP address into every transaction. It didn't. The whitepaper even has a section on privacy. It's incorrect to say that Bitcoin isn't focused on privacy.

The on chain Bitcoin system does not allow shorting.  But with the growth of Bitcoin derivatives ""paper bitcoin"" (similar to paper gold) Bitcoin at least technically could be attacked in a similar way that GME was.  The scale of Bitcoin at $1T market cap offers some protection.  But it could be smaller in the future.  If GME costs the shorts quite a bit of money in the end that offers some piece of mind towards potential future shorts on Bitcoin.

And the stopping of one direction of orders of GME highlights a potential flaw in the brokerage system.  The Bitcoin community should encourage the exchanges to pledge to never shut edown one way of trading but rather halt all trading if one direction becomes untenable.  Additionally the stoppage of buying was due to USD fund transfers taking 2 days to complete.  Many people point out Bitcoin can't handle millions of transactions a second and takes an hour not seconds to settle as a problem that prevents use as a medium of exchange.  Transferring Bitcoin is currently much quicker than large sums of cash.

3267,gov4i8f,t1_gou7njq,"I bought I think 480 for about 700 bucks and sold half when my money doubled. Worked part time for most of my adult life(although I ended up working more for something to keep me occupied) and sold bits and pieces and supplied my drug habit which got worse and worse until I got clean in 2017 but in doing so locked myself in my apartment for a year to get over benzo addiction and discovered that I could trade, traded for a bit, discovered I had a pretty crippling gambling addiction and essentially threw away my last 100 coins by taking riskier and riskier positions and I would win a fair amount but I would never take the money and eventually blow the account. 

It was worth millions in 2017 and I know it's going higher and I think it's probably going to be a million dollar asset reasonably soon. I knew it would happen from the get go bitcoin was too perfect of an invention and it markets itself because the users who know this are fanatics but they are fanatics because they see it. It had too many things going for it not to challenge gold. There's still scaling challenges but bitcoin is the only provably scarce asset in existence with it employs very clever game theory mechanics(including being open source) so that participants secure the system for a reward that far outweighs the cost to subvert the system and it utilizes cryptographic principals and functions to secure the system which make it theoretically unbreakable as long as P=NP. 

The genius of how satoshi solved the double spend problem(IE how do you stop digital data being duplicated) and the general btc security model were genius. Even today people don't understand the genius behind it and think they are making the new better bitcoin because it has 4x quicker block speeds or can do this one specific thing and sell it to people who don't know any better as the new bitcoin but the the truth is it's extremely unlikely that a new tech will gain anywhere near bitcoins reach. The original digital ledger is too well established(not that there ever was doubt in most bitcoiners minds anyway). Any improvements you can make to a blockchain data structure you could just build into bitcoin and fork the code to test your theory the market can decide and what's really clever here is no matter who wins if you dont sell either set of your coins you literally can't lose because you will have one copy of each so the incentive(even just for the sake of adoption) is to always use the bitcoin base layer if you want wider adoption(thus higher price).

It was stupid to do what I done It's just a little incredible to watch it in real time because it's really hard to grasp exponential growth, to watch something over 50,000x while people constantly call it a dead end tech and nothing but a bubble is pretty wild and I dont believe there will ever be another opportunity like that ever again that has that perfect setup and my first ever 'investment' it was a pretty good call. I only had to learn about it and see the silk road in action and thought - shit if this just catches on for this one use case it's worth a lot of money and there's a lot of use cases for a permission less ledger.

I must have sat through 5 bubbles until the money started become big and started affecting my judgement. When you turn what 140 bucks into 2mil in 7 years a lot of logic goes out the window. You know what though all that my life is much better now than it was throughout my 20's and I'm paying 10k of debt(yes that happened as well) so I've gone from fuck you money to broke and yes life genuinely is better right now. I consider it a life lesson in money wont make you happy(it certainly doesn't hurt though) and it doesn't really improve the quality of life(I didn't want to buy anything because I didn't have a need for it - maybe that was depression though). Now I just start again and look for a way to win round 2 of life, gets a little bit boring when your winning a little too hard right so gotta spice it up?

What's crazy is that multiple millions would have essentially been untraceabe(I know blockchain...). I bought it from an exchange of one of the early BTC developers(Amir Taaki) who was a bit of a cypherpunk(as they all were) and whose exchange closed in like 2011 or 2012 way before KYC/AML was even a thing in crypto and I doubt he's keeping any records. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is for a lot of people even during those times the community as a whole was convinced on it's value it's just some of us was shocked at just how quick it happened. Shit you used to be able to get free bitcoin by going to bitcoin faucets and those giveaways are worth hundreds of millions if not billions by now but the community  made it happen and the people who built those early projects and essentially marketed bitcoin(this is btc's real strength is network effect) and gave it away for free so people could learn about it(Andreas) and those who didn't STFU about bitcoin until everyone was sick of us(this was before 2013) are the bitcoin strengths. 

Now 10 years later people kick themselves because I didn't STFU about it when it was in the double digits  and even a days pay would be like half a million dollars or something. No better marketing than a good idea, a fanatical userbase and the power of memes(and a pretty kick ass origin story). People said exactly the same things now as they did then 'what if it crashes'. BTC is at a bit of an inflection point as it can't keep growing without pushing TX fees up which prices a lot of people out of using the first layer to settle a transaction so lets see where this thing goes from here and how the community react because that's who truly control the network.",t3_lszkpw,2021-02-27 02:42:29,2021-02-27

3354,goykdf0,t1_gouve5m,"I spent hundreds of coins because I wanted to stimulate the Bitcoin economy and make it a viable alternative currency. Give my last coin to an ex-gfs uncle in 2014 as a novelty Christmas gift and never bought again because I was broke and living on credit cards and student loans. 

Do I regret anything? Of fucking course. I once bought $40 worth of MTG cards on some website with like 3.5 coins and thought I was getting a deal at the time because I bought the coins for $8. I traded those cards to some store for pennies when I was hard up for cash just a few years later. 

My best friend, who was a very early adopter, committed suicide after the price went over $1k and then dropped back to $200. His coins today would be worth over $10 million. Shortly after he died, his family asked me to crack the passwords on his phone and laptop. I did, and I found his coin wallets. I gave the passwords for all his wallets to his long time girlfriend because I believed they belonged to her as his partner and his family wanted nothing to do with the delusional internet money that led him to commit the most shameful of acts.

I could have transferred some, or all of them, to myself. I could have told his family and his gf that I couldn’t figure out the password. Some days I wish I had done this wrong thing. But I also know I probably would have sold it all at $5,000. Or definitely at $10,000. I hope she held. We haven’t spoken since. 

Regardless. I’m not bitter about any of it. I’m glad to have played whatever role I did in talking about BTC with friends and family in the early 2010s, and telling them how they should just buy a few and use them to help start a revolution in currency. I’m mostly just incredulous at the price today and still skeptical of the mania that surrounds the price of Bitcoin “in dollars.” 

I am glad to have been a part of the novelty. And hope it achieves the lofty goals it was created to accomplish. However, I fear that it has become just another tool for speculation, and that the current fervor will ultimately leave a lot of hopeful people holding the bag if/when the next hot thing comes along. I’ll never forget the pain of losing one of the people I loved most in this world because, I believe, he was depressed and then saw the “value” of his main investment drop by 80% in just a few months. I am worried it will happen again, and many more will feel that same pain...which no amount of money can ever alleviate.",t3_lszkpw,2021-02-27 15:57:31,2021-02-27

And if you happen to lose it anyway, you have options to recover it, if you've done things right.

3468,gozz136,t1_goxrv8f,"“Not your keys: not your coins” is a mantra to live by, but like everything else in life, there is room for nuance. The important thing to realize is that keeping it on Coinbase comes with its own set of requirements from you. Is your email protected by time-based 2FA? Do you use a strong password for your email? How about for Coinbase itself? Do you have 2FA turned on for withdrawals? The weakest link is still what you do/don’t do. Coinbase also has some more “secure” options for long-term retail storage. 

If you can do those things, I would think you are reasonably safe. You still have to worry about some degree of counter party risk and you may/may not be able to access that money in timely fashion if there is any sort of outage. Bequeathing the coins will probably be easier since you don’t need to entrust the private key to an attorney or loved once before it is time. They can claim your assets on Coinbase no differently than they would a brokerage account.

If you are willing to allow someone to custody your BTC, you should also look into platforms like BlockFi. You will then be able to earn some kind of yield on your coins.
 
I would still encourage you to do some research on cold storage solutions. You can play around with Litecoin while you get familiar with transferring and securing cryptocurrency. When you’re ready, transfer some or all of your BTC into a wallet secured by some kind of hardware device (Cold Card, Ledger, Trezor). Keep in mind it is the seed phrase that is important and not the device itself. Make sure you have tested recreating your wallet from the seed before putting everything in the safe for 30 years. Keep multiple copies of your seed and inscribe it in something water and fire proof. As long as you know your seed phrase, there will software out that that will allow you to regain access to your funds.",t3_lszkpw,2021-02-27 21:35:10,2021-02-27

As /u/steadyhandhide said, do you use two-factor or multi-factor authentication with your email address and on Coinbase? It's the same as you should be doing with your bank or brokerage account, to protect your assets.

Also, I *completely* agree with the idea of storing your coins at BlockFi. If you are intending to just hold your cryptos long term and not sell them, BlockFi pays great interest rates on a handful of cryptos and stablecoins including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and USDC.

4026,gp00962,t3_ltipvd,"Yassine Elmandjra provided 12 points to consider in response to articles such as this one.

1/ Bitcoin critics continue to assert that mining is wasteful and disproportionately damaging to the environment. 

Contrary to consensus thinking, we believe the impact of bitcoin mining is a net positive for the environment.

Here's why:

2/ First, proof-of-work mining is critical to Bitcoin. In the Bitcoin network, trustworthiness is protected by computation, and mining is what gives Bitcoin its ability to coordinate trust and facilitate the transfer of value without relying on a centralized authority.

3/ The costliness to produce bitcoin is fundamental to its value. 

Unlike the US dollar, Bitcoin cannot be printed with the stroke of a keyboard.

Instead, it converts the output from cheap stranded energy sources into something with monetary value.

4/ Even so, Bitcoin’s energy consumption is trivial compared to legacy financial systems. As measured by electricity costs alone, Bitcoin is much more efficient than traditional banking and gold mining on a global scale.

5/ Traditional banking consumes 2.34 B GJ/yr and gold mining 500 M GJ/yr, while Bitcoin consumes 184 M GJ/yr.  Additionally, Bitcoin mining’s estimated $ cost / GJ expanded is 40X more efficient than that of traditional banking and 10X more efficient than gold mining.

6/ Another common mistake energy detractors make is to naively extrapolate Bitcoin’s energy consumption to the equivalent CO2 emissions. What matters is the type of energy source being used to generate electricity.

7/ In reality, renewables account for the largest percentage of bitcoin’s energy mix. In the search for the cheapest form of electricity, miners flock to regions offering a glut of renewable electricity, unlocking stranded energy assets.

8/ In some instances, Bitcoin mining is even helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by consuming methane that would have been leaked into the atmosphere via flaring.

9/ ""That energy would have been wasted, as is evidenced by the existence of flare stacks. That gas is flared because it can't be brought to market. Bitcoin miners are incentivized to show up and consume that wasted energy.""

10/ ""If Bitcoin ends up being worth substantially more in the future Bitcoin’s energy expenditure may end up looking rather cheap in the final analysis.""

11/ Coins only need to be issued once. And it’s better for the planet that they be issued when the coin price was low, and the electricity expended to extract them was commensurately low.

12/ In summary, Bitcoin does not waste energy.
It is clear that because Bitcoin’s footprint is so easy to quantify, it is singled out for special treatment.",t3_ltipvd,2021-02-27 21:39:47,2021-02-27

4032,gp0k7ql,t3_ltipvd,"Okay, all the nonsense about the BBC having an ""agenda"" aside, this article is woefully researched. It relies heavily upon data coming from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), indeed this appears to be their only source.

This paragraph caught my eye in particular:

>The CCAF team surveys the people who manage the Bitcoin network around the world on their energy use and found that about two-thirds of it is from fossil fuels.

Now to be honest, this is the crux of the entire article. If Bitcoin was being powered mainly by renewables then the article and associated FUD is complete crap, right? Yeah. So it's interesting because I've read a study where it was shown that this is indeed the case, whether it be from Chinese hydro, to Icelandic geothermal or Kazakhstani solar, the author of that study claimed an energy mix comprised over over 75% renewables! This, if true, kills the FUD.

So where are CCAF getting this 2/3 fossil fuels claim from then? 

Er, as it turns out, if you actually read their website - **they're not claiming this at all**.

CCAF's Bitoin data comes from their dedicated project, the [Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index](https://cbeci.org/). You can navigate very easily to the FAQ section, where you will read:

>**What are Bitcoin’s carbon dioxide emissions?**

>It is important to understand that energy consumption is not necessarily equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions and environmental pollution. For instance, one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated by a coal-fired power station has a substantially different environmental footprint than one kWh of electricity produced by a solar park. 

>In order to determine Bitcoin’s carbon dioxide emissions, and thus its real environmental footprint, the actual energy mix (i.e. sources of energy used to produce electricity) needs to be examined more closely. While some mining facilities disclose the energy sources used to power their machines, the exact energy mix of the majority of mining farms remains unknown.

>More recently, studies have shown that a growing share of total electricity consumption originates from renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar, and wind power. However, estimates are varying widely, ranging from approximately 20% 1 of the total energy mix to more than 70%.2

So *directly from the source*, they admit they do not know, and that potentially it could be over 70%

Does this kill the FUD? Yes this kills the FUD.

I mean, is having the freedom to control your own money less important than flying a small city worth of people, cars and supplies around the world every year for formula one races? 

Another example is tourism- in which millions, maybe billions, of people travel each year for no real reason at all.  Everybody talks about the environmental damage of bitcoin (a lot of which is probably run on green energy and not actually damaging at all) but nobody wants to talk about how most of us get into a big airplane and fly thousands of miles to hang out somewhere for a week or two every year and the massive carbon emissions from that.

It’s far from perfect but I see a much worse future if it was entirely defunded. 

And I’m not sure about the Marxist argument, I would likely correlate the BBC with public schoolboys, conservatives and the Eton elite. They’re always going to try and shit on Bitcoin so long as they’re not in it.
