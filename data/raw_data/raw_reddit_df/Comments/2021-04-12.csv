It has now been 90 days (or 3 months) since we made the $1,000 bet about whether Bitcoin would be above $60k or below $20k within 2-3 months.

After the first 2 months, you accepted that I was right, but said we should wait until the full 3 months was over before we count our chickens.

People   should care about decentralization. Maybe this fresh crop of noobs   doesn't care, but they will care too - once they lose 90% in a bear   market, or their shitcoin of choice joins [this list](https://99bitcoins.com/deadcoins/).   No institution is going to replace trust in elected officials   (politicians and bankers who control the money supply) with trust in [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwfYG6FG71Y)   or someone like him. These shitcoins have no floor. No state will use   some shitcoin that has a CEO-like figure at the helm as a reserve   currency. This next huge wave of money (institutional and state) is all   going into Bitcoin. Tesla bought Bitcoin. Many will follow. Nation   states will follow.

And the   argument ""people don't care about centralization anymore"" is irrelevant.   There were many attempts to create digital money in the past. They all   failed. They failed precisely because they all had a central point of   failure. So, one by one, these shitcoins will fail, it's inevitable.   That will make people care. That SEC lawsuit hurt r\*ppl\*, but it's   really nothing. When you're truly decentralized, there's nobody to sue.   There will be arrests, kidnappings, who know what else. These shitcoins   are becoming targets, and they will be attacked.

You   can't kidnap Bill Gates and make him send you his Microsoft shares.   This space is unregulated and it's wild west out there. In the end, only   Bitcoin will stand, because it's a question of optimization too. If it   works, that's all we need. There will be other protocols, but they  will  all run on bitcoin (wrapped or something similar). No need for  native  tokens. All DeFi and NFTs and other bullshit can run on bitcoin,  and  they all eventually will.

Different reasons:  

No fee estimation algorithm can predict the future, but this is what they essentially trying to do. Fees depend on A) how high you set the fee rate (in sat/vbyte), B) how many other transactions with same or higher fees are currently competing with yours and C) how many transactions with higher paid fees will be broadcast after yours.

A) you can influence directly, B) you can observe in real time, but C) is difficult to predict.

Another reason is that during nights and weekends there are naturally a bit less transactions going on the network, so that's why you might have an impression that you get quicker confirmations.  

Then there is natural variance in mining: a new block can take ten minutes or fifty minutes or just a few seconds to appear. The ten minutes between blocks that are often quoted is the *average* time. The time between ""actual"" blocks can vary by quite a bit, which you can see by looking at any blockexplorer like this: https://blockstream.info/ (check out the timestamps between blocks).",t3_mp827n,2021-04-12 20:06:37,2021-04-12
648,gu8wkl1,t1_gu8cy9w,"Blocks always take approximately the same time to resolve, about 10 mins. It all depends on how much is people bidding to get their transactions included by miners, so basically demand/offer.

The key constraint is the Bitcoin block size limit. Miners will prioritize operations with a better satoshi-to-transaction size ratio. 

You can check the current state of the network in https://mempool.space/, it indicates how many sats per byte would get your transaction included in the next few blocks and the same statistic for the past 5 blocks or so.

Last night fees were really low at about 5 sats/byte getting you included in the next 10/20/30 minutes. A higher fee will result in bidding more BTC to get included.",t3_mp827n,2021-04-12 20:27:06,2021-04-12

I have no idea about bitcoin mining, but I would guess something similar would apply here.

But given you had to get schooled later in the thread about how independent probabilities work im not surprised you had this dumb af take.

But ill reword it as an ELI5

If you consistently make unrelated predictions without any form of informed model you will trend towards a 50 >>>> or lower <<<<< accuracy rate because you are making yourself a victim of statistical averages.

Given the probabilities of most events in this universe are lower than 50% you will trend to lower than 50%

But you cannot trend to higher than 50%.

If you trending to a number higher than 50% it means you arent ""throwing darts at a wall and seeing what sticks"" theres some kind of model you are using to predict the events with a degree of accuracy.

Yes, bitcoin core.  All the mempool sorting is based on a floating point calculation based on fees in the form of satoshis / 1000 bytes.

Targeted internet shut down / massive DDOS against the main mining crews.  Possibly combined with air strikes if the locations are known (not too hard to find out.)

Probably a single super power could do it.  All of them acting together I would think definitely could.

Their tune has changed, but only cause of the profits snd being yelled at by clients to get them exposed to it. It's not like Dalio or Jamie Dimon suddenly sound like they know a ton about crypto. They're just capitulating and hoping they can take all the profits for themselves and control these markets too once they figure out how to game it. But from talking to investment bankers and wealth advisors, my experience is they don't understand that many of the tricks that work for equities won't work for crypto. 

By the time they realize why a lot of chain tech is called trustless it'll be too late and very difficult to answer the question, ""If identity verification and the authenticity of a wine bottle and even the inflation of one coin (DAI) by the price arbitrage of another (Maker  - the arbitrage the HFT's will understand) can all be handled by chain and DeFi systems that keep everything above board... then why can't stock trades?""

Maybe I'm naive, but what I see is a lot of coin projects being created for the express purpose of securing something. For keeping a system transparent. If there's one system that doesn't want to be truly secure or transparent, it's the U.S. stock exchange.

When it comes to crypto, more than half that I've spoken to don't even realize the exchanges are open 24 hours a day. Their chief takeaway will likely be that they're gonna need a bigger boat... of cocaine, cause there's no premarket or earnings reports or dark pools to manipulate.

And if you do that, why can't a project like The Graph make it all searchable? 

The questions that arise from the tech and thought process behind the many projects out there are WAY more dangeous to governments and the elites because the increasing adoption of various coins to create secure and transparent systems as well as generate liquidity as a function of the system while increasing value elsewhere make systemic corruption and manipulation a lot more difficult to maintain.
