I am new to BTC. Even though i understand the tech and concept for many years, but just started buying and DCAing from 18th December last year. My average buying price is 31K and anything above that is good news. Planning to hodl for long term. My portfolio is 85% BTC and remaining in other cryptos (just to test the waters).

I just want to share that apart from US and Europe, there is a lot of activity in the Middle East around blockchain and crypto currencies, especially in rich countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain. The governments here are very supportive, and the Central Banks here are also pro crypto. In fact, there are 2 new exchanges here licensed by Central Banks, where you can buy and sell BTC, via credit cards and bank transfers.

It is estimated that a lot of money will flow into BTC from this region. One estimate from the RAIN crypto exchange expects between 18 and 20 billion dollars being invested in BTC in 2021 from these countries.

So the signs are positive and hoping for BTC to go to moon and beyond.

Happy DCAing and hodling.",t3_lhf5vj,2021-02-11 19:49:20,2021-02-11

I recently was commented on Twitter that Bitcoin is gonna crash and burn and that i'm an idiot.

Since i hold various other crypto as well im active on several subreddits similar like religion i respect one and the other.

Someone posted this article [https://darknetdaily.com/?p=1648](https://darknetdaily.com/?p=1648)

And claims Bitcoin is doomed for this etc...

So i tried to explain this person that this is a common problem with every custodial wallet regardless what crypto any exchange can block your account and hold your funds.

That it was stupid to receive funding on a wallet address from an exchange instead of holding a wallet where the person also holds the keys.

Nothing has stopped bitcoin from becoming this big, not KYC not KYT or whatever they will come up with.

Bitcoin is not bound to ant law and can't be outlawed as many have tried.

Any argument against it is useless because of this.

If you hold your private keys there are no restrictions.

If you hold your assets in an exchange you are bound to their rules, you own nothing.",t3_lhf5vj,2021-02-11 22:50:16,2021-02-11

with that said. My experience with lightning includes a couple custodial wallets, and one failed noncustodial wallet instance with zap back when it first launched. (RIP 2 million sats)

for now I view lightning wallets as cash for small amounts. if I can wrap my hands around a non custodial solution, maybe that will change/expand to something more.

my favorite lightning wallet at the moment is zebedee's wallet. zbd.gg 

short simple domain name, that gives you a tag/your own domain with your lightning wallet. example: zbd.gg/bitc0in

the amazing thing to me about this wallet is the static address that they support. so you don't have to do any of the ln request stuff. it functions just like a regular bitcoin address in practice. the problem is some lightning wallets don't support that address type. but hopefully that changes long term, as requesting payment is a extra step for both parties. 

I'm also a big fan of the zebedee lightning gaming they have going on over at mintgox.com

Option 2 is asking too much more 95% of users and isn't the easiest for on-the-go payments either.

Now imagine that you give the truck to Bob, without telling your parents. Then he gives you a doll. Then a football, and so on, as much as you want. Then, whenever you want to stop playing, you can go to your parents and tell them: now I have the truck and the doll, and Bob has the football. Cool, you played a lot without wasting time going to your parents! (this is the Lighting Network).

That's it! Parents are Bitcoin's block chain. You're doing transactions without them knowing, but in the end they settle any argument that you and your brother might have.

That's incorrect. There are those two extremes indeed, but they are not the norm. Plenty of non-custodial wallets out there, which let you use their nodes (just as the majority of regular bitcoin wallets are utilizing the wallet's default nodes, not the user's full node). I'm not totally up to date with wallets, but I am f.ex using Eclair (android), which is non-custodial but doesn't require me to run my own node. Electrum (desktop) has a Lightning function as well.

712,gmxw8f3,t1_gmxrlef,">when will lightning be fully implemented?

It's already fully implemented by a number of implementations.  Development continues, but that is the story of every open-source project.  Consider that even after 3 decades the Linux kernel is still undergoing development.  This is a state of open-source software that is called ""continuous beta"": improvements will be thought up and implemented, continuously.

> Will it be used more than the regular bitcoin network that's used today? 

I expect that most ordinary people will touch Lightning more often than Bitcoin.  You'd do something like get your salary over Lightning, then pay out to your bills and buy whatever you like.  Then maybe you save up some money, and once you have a good amount on Lightning, maybe make a Lightning->onchain swap to put it in cold storage.  Then in the future when you have to make a big purchase you can pay onchain, or if you're starting your own business and have to pay lots of salaries for multiple employees you might make an onchain->Lightning swap of your saved-up funds to start the business then start paying out over Lightning.

So for most people, you'd be using Lightning far more often than the blockchain layer itself.  But there will always be blockchain transactions and the blockchain layer is going to be almost always full.

> I heard it wasn't yet completely developed, when will it be fully developed?

See above.  It's already developed and in production use.  It's not ""finished"" because being ""finished"" means it is not useful anymore and nobody wants to extends its capabilities.

Open source is never ""fully implemented"". I mean, implemented where? By whom? How? Lightning is a network, similar to bitcoin, or even to the internet. Is the internet ""fully implemented""? What is meant by it in the first place?

753,gmxur2g,t1_gmxtqvx,"Not necessarily.  Many Lightning software run SPV.  They depend on the honesty of the Bitcoin fullnode backing the SPV node, but keep privkeys locally.  So it's a bit of a spectrum of custodiality.  You still hold your keys to your coins, but the SPV server can lie to you and hide the fact that somebody has stolen the coins in your channel by simply not telling your wallet that the channel funding outpoint has been spent.  This is known as an ""eclipse"" attack since the server hides the view of the network from you.

On the other hand, you could talk to multiple SPV servers.  For example, Neutrino (BIP157/BIP158) is already merged into Bitcoin Core and a growing number of nodes support this.  So your SPV Lightning wallet can connect to multiple fullnodes that advertise Neutrino support, and if at least one of them is honest, you can learn about theft attempts and punish the theft.  A widespread network of SPV servers would be fairly helpful to escape eclipse attacks.",t3_lhl18h,2021-02-11 22:23:58,2021-02-11

I'm not the right person to discuss this with because I'm not sure how exactly Eclair works under the hood, but as far as I know your private keys are on your phone only, Eclair cannot control your funds. You have to rely on their backend for transactions but this is just how any average bitcoin wallet works (the ones that don't let you connect to your own full node). If their backend goes down, you cannot transact (and have recover your funds in another wallet or desktop Eclair connected to your own node), but you are the only one who controls the private keys, i.e. the funds.

See: https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lhl18h/lightning_thursday_february_11th_2021_explore_the/gmxur2g/

I think Eclair can be configured to use the Electrum server network though, the Electrum server protocol even has convenient queries that are needed to validate the channel map (this is a pain point when using say LND with the Neutrino backend, since BIP157/158 has no way to validate channel maps).  So you might not be relying on a single Eclair server, but could talk to many possible servers, which lets you escape an eclipse attack that much more easily.  Better check your settings and ask an Eclair expert though, I'm a C-Lightning dweeb.",t3_lhl18h,2021-02-11 22:28:26,2021-02-11

If it’s in their possession they will earn interest on everyone’s bitcoin and just give you a small percentage much less than what you would get normally.

In all of these cases, cryptocurrencies still don’t move through our network. Our crypto partners convert the digital assets on their end to traditional currencies, then transmit them through to the Mastercard network. Our change to supporting digital assets directly will allow many more merchants to accept crypto — an ability that’s currently limited by proprietary methods unique to each digital asset. This change will also cut out inefficiencies, letting both consumers and merchants avoid having to convert back and forth between crypto and traditional to make purchases.

Added to this work, Mastercard is actively engaging with several major central banks around the world, as they review plans to launch new digital currencies, dubbed CBDCs, to offer their citizens a new way to pay.

Is giving up 5 of the 10 Bitcoins you bought for $3500 up to buy a house for you and your pregnant wife advisable? Probably so. 

Every man has a reason to jump out which overrides his FOMO about continued price jumps and...remember...The ""price"" of bitcoin is really the exchange rate in terms of the inflationary shitcoin issued by the U.S. Federal reserve called ""Federal Reserve Notes"" and they have no supply limit.

Second layers have to operate in this way. You said:

>even in LN whitepaper they are honest that the net settlement must be on bitcoin blockchain to give you the security of bitcoin

Implying Lightning is somehow less secure than Bitcoin. It's not, and your claim that it needs to settle on Bitcoin's main chain for security is nonsense. It needs to settle on Bitcoin's main chain to be able to move Bitcoin. Though you can keep a lightning channel open indefinitely, and if it remains balanced, there is no reason to settle it.

>Only between the 2 parties, it's not settled in the bitcoin distributed network.

It's settled so far as the entire lightning network is concerned. It only matters if they need to either open a chain to an address which is otherwise totally inaccessible to them over Lightning (you don't need a direct chain; that's a fundamental part of Lightning), or if you want to move it into cold storage off of the Lightning network.

>Is LN more secure than an actual transaction with the usual 5 confirmations.

Fuck right off, you know how dumb this comparison is.

You can't rely on 5 confirmations for day-to-day purchases, because 5 confirmations will take, at a minumum, 40 minutes and a second. Lightning is just as secure as the rest of the network, and for payments where you're not able to sit around and wait for 5 confirmations before handing over the goods, it's more secure.

Even waiting for 1 confirmation is utterly impractical for the vast majority of day-to-days.",t3_lh4ezx,2021-02-11 21:34:40,2021-02-11

A transaction in a block with 5 confirmations is not only set in stone - the amount of work to undo such transaction is orders of magnitude more than polishing a stone clone. It's set in stone and buried in a 1km deep hole.

With LN you can still lose your funds in the channel with penalty transaction, thus effectively undoing your transaction, for example. No one can ever affect my balance on blockchain unless they get the keys.

By the way, I am not saying LN is bad or anything, I'm just saying you can't compare the security of LN with real blockchain.

Bitcoin is deflationary in tendency. That means that it doesn't make sense for people to actually buy anything with it.

But anonymous cryptos like monero have to go, as it is really only used for buying illegal stuff like drugs and child pornography on the dark web.

And smart contract blockchains will at some point be crowded out until one or two cryptos similar to ETH will dominate the market.

The moment that this happens, Bitcoin will leave the scene.

You may tell yourself that a ""currency"" that is not under the control of a national bank is somehow a tool for your financial liberation, but the reality is that there are very good reasons why national banks are printing money to produce inflation, because without that inflation there is no incentive for people to spend their money and push it through an economy to produce added value.",t3_lhho8p,2021-02-11 22:56:50,2021-02-11

3674,gmxayrh,t3_lhhtfz,I think I also saw today that they’re looking at ways Twitter users can “tip” each other on the site with crypto. Definitely bullish,t3_lhhtfz,2021-02-11 18:36:35,2021-02-11
3675,gmx9s4d,t3_lhhtfz,I think these are the beginnings of mass adoption yes. We are on a good track.,t3_lhhtfz,2021-02-11 18:18:12,2021-02-11

3690,gmxshq0,t1_gmxayrh,Yeah I assume they’re waiting until lightning is fully integrated by cashapp. Lightning tips running on the cashapp lightning backbone sounds like a killer application for both Square & Twitter,t3_lhhtfz,2021-02-11 22:05:12,2021-02-11
